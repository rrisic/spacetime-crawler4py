glassdoor s list of the 50 best jobs in american for 2020 which shouldn t be too surprising given the rise of big data and growing demand for empirical based decision making across many industries to help meet this demand the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics is currently accepting applications for the new master of data science mds program it is launching in the fall of 2021 anyone interested in joining the inaugural cohort of this 15 month professional graduate program can apply online the early application deadline is december 15th 2020 after that applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until april 15th 2021 we see lots of demand coming from individuals who were trained in computer science for example without rigorous statistical training says daniel gillen chair of the department of statistics we also see demand coming from individuals who were trained in mathematical sciences and statistics but don t have the computing background he continues and then there are a lot of individuals coming from other disciplines as well from business analytics backgrounds and from political and social science backgrounds so whether you re in the tech industry at a financial institution in a domain such as education or healthcare or a recent graduate looking for more training this program is designed to advance your data science skills while there are minimum course requirements the goal is to fill certain gaps in training while providing practical hands on experience what makes this program unique is that it is going to be taught and delivered by world renowned experts in the foundations of data science meaning both statistics and computing says gillen the courses will cover applied probability and mathematical statistics statistical modeling and computing machine learning data management and visualization and artificial intelligence more importantly they will be evenly split between faculty from the department of statistics and the department of computer science both of which are housed in the school of ics industry is learning very quickly that a lot of people can scrape and analyze data but to do something truly meaningful with data to make decisions that will drive the industry forward you really have to have a basic foundational understanding of the methods you re using says gillen that is what drives the philosophy of this degree the program spans five quarters with the first three quarters comprising coursework in both statistics and computer science the summer quarter is available for internships or additional courses to accommodate working professionals all courses will be offered in the late afternoon or evening and for those in need of financial assistance scholarships and financial aid are available the final quarter is the capstone course where students will work on industry derived projects gaining real world hands on experience we plan to partner with businesses to help generate not only contacts for students but also interesting capstone projects if your business is interested in sponsoring a capstone project please contact bryan munoz at mds ics uci edu furthermore because this program adds to the list of successful professional programs already offered through the school of ics students will have access to dedicated career counselors and will participate in showcase events so while the goal is to keep the initial mds cohort relatively small students will be able to leverage resources and events available through the established graduate programs it will be fairly selective so we re aiming at 50 students for the first cohort says gillen though that might grow in future years this select group of students will gain experience in using relevant data related software and technologies so they can thrive as data scientists whether their goal is to work in the tech industry or government or anywhere in between we re going to focus on taking what is learned about the foundations of these disciplines stresses gillen and applying them to real world data shani murray a campus gem uci s statistical consulting servicesa look at health and technology trends for 2021 and

statistics current course listings news seminars news seminar center for statistical consulting a look at health and technology trends for 2021 and beyond january 15 2021 the fields of computer science informatics and statistics have been influencing healthcare for decades and 2020 served as an important reminder of the critical role both healthcare and technology play in people s daily lives the covid 19 pandemic put a spotlight on healthcare while stay at home orders significantly boosted technology use in general and telehealth practices in particular looking to the new year ahead how might the connections between technology and health become further entwined and how will this impact the future of healthcare here to address these questions are three professors from the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics yunan chen associate professor of informatics whose research focuses on human computer interaction hci computer supported cooperative work cscw and health informatics nikil dutt distinguished professor of computer science who studies embedded systems healthcare iot computer aided design and brain inspired architectures and computing and bin nan professor of statistics who works to improve human health through the development of statistical and machine learning methods professors chen dutt and nan each discuss new opportunities and challenges as advances in technology lead to fundamental shifts in the healthcare industry how is your field influencing the healthcare industry and what changes do you expect to see in the next few decades yunan chen chen informatics has had a huge influence on the healthcare industry the medical field is centered on the use of information in fact the field of medical informatics was established to meet the growing demand to collect access and use health data and information in the past five to 10 years health it systems have almost completely transformed paper based medical practices into electronic health records as everything becomes digitalized huge amounts of information and data can be collected and shared across practices opening the door to new clinical research and health policies another major influence stems from the digitalization of our everyday life with advances in consumer facing health it applications individuals can now collect manage and use personal health data that was not available in the past this information can then be shared with clinicians to benefit their practices across different settings clinical home or communities informatics research and applications are helping people better access information gather data and engage in evidence based practices leading to improved public health nikil dutt dutt one big shift we re seeing is this notion of digital health the idea of using technology for better self care it s this whole idea that even the field of medicine is recognizing called p4 health which is predictive preventive personalized and participatory health instead of the traditional model of episodic healthcare where you go to the doctor or er when you re sick we re moving toward proactively shifting the emphasis to earlier phases in terms of lifestyle digital health technologies including computer science informatics and statistics are the key enablers moving us in that direction we ve always talked about personalized health but now technology lets us use data and statistics to build models of individuals that can improve the quality of healthcare by delivering services in a more targeted fashion another tremendous shift we have seen just this past year is the move to remote healthcare and telehealth covid 19 accelerated the move to delivering services using technology the other thing that we ll be soon talking about is integrating mental and physical health far too often physical and mental care are siloed and services are provided in a completely uncoordinated fashion so i see a big change with personalization and this ability to integrate all of that information in a manner that can help healthcare professionals better do their jobs and more importantly help individuals empower themselves to make decisions in an informed manner bin nan nan statistics plays a very important role in any health related research the field of so called biostatistics is evidence of that where the emphasis is on health and medical research i can name many interesting influential topics such as survival analysis and longitudinal data analysis in the past two decades technology has evolved so that people can perform fine sequencing of dna information there are also many impacts along the lines of imaging especially in neuroscience research the brain is a very interesting organ that you usually cannot access so you can t directly measure brain activity you have to rely on imaging in both areas massive data are generated and that motivates some interesting statistical research in a fast growing area called high dimensional statistics in the coming years people will increasingly use wearable devices to track data including activity data and heartbeat and temperature measurements this presents statistical challenges in terms of how you analyze the data and how you design interventions to improve human health such as a message that says you should exercise more or you need to relax i m part of uci s new institute for future health ifh led by ramesh jain and the focus is on trying to understand how we collect and use mobile device data to improve health this will be a very interesting field that s depending on technology involvement as wearable devices with well designed apps become more and more available to people so we call this the big data era new statistical methods are being developed and some of them will become much more impactful in these scientific areas which will certainly reshape scientific knowledge in the future what about covid 19 s influence how did the global pandemic impact your research chen covid is not only a global public health crisis but also an information crisis our past research in this area shows that during a public health crisis information is often uncertain and ambiguous challenging how people perceive personal risks and make decisions it is crucial for informatics researchers like us to examine the use of information and technologies during this challenging time i ve been doing a multicultural study on contact tracing technologies for covid 19 in the u s korea and japan working with informatics professor daniel epstein and a group of international collaborators we started looking at human tracers and technology tracers and under different conditions when people prefer humans versus technology one of our findings to be presented at chi 21 is that when people have to report their symptoms during a 14 day quarantine they prefer technology check ins but when being notified of a covid positive diagnosis or of exposure to the virus people prefer to talk to a human so they can ask questions and receive emotional assurance right now we re doing a similar study in korea and also a survey in japan as they recently rolled out their national covid tracing system i ve also worked on a collaborative project looking into people s risk perceptions during the pandemic and how those perceptions might change as the pandemic wears on again findings to be presented at chi 21 in another study we looked into the beliefs of those who oppose facial masks we used a combination of machine learning and qualitative content analysis methods to analyze twitter data from january to october 2020 this study reveals the temporal trend of public opinions and the reasons why some people do not support mask wearing helping us understand public concerns and learn how to better communicate health policies to the public dutt one of the big projects i m working on is called unite underserved communities which provides services so that underserved pregnant women can take better care of themselves the project uses what we call a community health worker model where a community health worker traditionally goes in and visits with the mom periodically what we were looking at is how wearable technology can provide ubiquitous continuous monitoring that closes the loop by augmenting what happens during the physical visits we re doing the pilot study now so covid actually allowed us to test this intervention which became even more important when health workers could no longer visit the women at their homes so i think that provided us with an opportunity to test it and show that digital services can help people in this instance pregnant moms take better care of themselves also together with psychology professor jesse borelli we were looking at stress management of college kids we started this before covid recruiting between 10 to 30 students for each cohort using a combination of physiological monitoring with wearables and ecological momentary assessment ema questionnaires delivered on an app we combined the students physical health with their mental health state to evaluate and track their stress levels over time and provide feedback as covid hit we saw huge rises in stress levels it was extremely important to see what these kids were going through but it s also very exciting to use these digital technologies to build a personalized model nan covid did not interrupt my research too much since most of my research activities are now on zoom meanwhile i got a chance to work with professor jonathan watanabe from the uci school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences who is interested in how doctors treat covid 19 patients he was trying to understand the patterns of different medicine use over time among different patient categories the data set that we used was from the electronic health records another source of big data for health research of the uc system we have five medical schools and many many hospitals in the uc system and we have access to that data which is updated on a daily basis about what medicines were prescribed to the patients this is observational and descriptive not a clinical evaluation but it s very interesting work covid 19 has also highlighted racial disparities in healthcare what role do you think racial justice plays in healthcare and technology chen it definitely plays a huge role there have been recent studies outside of the healthcare world about how if the training data of ai systems does not include a certain population then the algorithms developed based on such data might lead to potential bias in the healthcare field i could imagine such scenarios in future ai assistant practices if the systems don t have enough training data for underrepresented populations or economically disadvantaged communities that could lead to serious consequences since we don t have universal healthcare in the u s it s really hard for some people to afford certain treatments for example infertility treatments if a technology is developed based on patient data with participation only by people who can afford it then bias can be embedded into the design i ve also seen studies looking into how technology can help clinicians avoid implicit bias when treating patients if they subconsciously describe things differently to different patients or maybe use a different tone or style of interaction if we look at the future of the entire healthcare industry and insurance more broadly there have been some articles about how if you are inherently prone to develop some kind of disease based on your medical history we would have different kinds of insurance that s one of the ethical issues we discuss in my medical informatics class with more algorithms and decision support being deployed in the healthcare field we need to be careful to not widen health disparity or inequity through technology design dutt that s so important we have a planning grant with nursing colleagues professor amir rahmani and dean adey nyamathi for a new nsf program called the future of work our grant digital health for future of community centered care is looking at community centered care because we all know that a large part of the cost of healthcare comes from training doctors and nurses but if you look at underserved populations community workers are the ones who actually interface with people and then report back to nurses or doctors so we feel that technology can empower and grow these types of services to help underserved communities especially in this climate so you asked what role does racial justice play and i m kind of turning that around saying technology has a tremendous role to play in providing services for the most underserved communities an example is the work we re doing through unite with moms orange county but i think we can take that kind of model and scale it i ll give you two instances that we ve discussed one is looking at mechanisms to help deliver services to the homeless community and another one is the meals on wheels program which delivers food to typically underserved elderly populations and these individuals are not only underserved but also might be going through life changes where they may be having early onset of dementia or they might not be taking care of themselves so how can we use technology to help identify problems early and communicate and address that nan in healthcare we see racial discrepancies all the time for example i was involved in a project looking at medicare data for end stage renal disease patients usually the standard treatment is dialysis for this cms centers for medicare medicaid services project we developed measures to evaluate the performance of dialysis facilities one of the issues we often see is racial discrepancy it s always there sometimes disparities can be explained biologically different genetic makeup for example but many are actually due to the social economic status how to address that is the billion dollar question people of color have disadvantages in terms of access to quality healthcare which directly impacts their health status there s a big debate about universal healthcare but i think that in a rich country like the u s everyone should have a certain level of care what other major challenges do we as a society need to address in the next five years chen now that we are able to collect a large amount of personal health data both by healthcare professionals and consumers the major challenge we face is how to better utilize such data to meet the diverse needs of stakeholders we often hear clinicians complaining about not having enough time to review the data patient brought to the clinic or patients being confused or distressed by their own health data there are structured constraints in our healthcare system that do not allocate physicians enough time to perform the data work brought on by new technologies on the consumer side users might not have sufficient knowledge skills and literacy to manage their own data and health how do we design health it systems that both provide data access as well as allow appropriate use of such data avoiding unintended negative consequences so beyond the technical aspect the human and social aspects of design are even more important how do you visualize and present the data to different stakeholders sometimes the systems also generate suggestions or predictions you might get diabetes if you continue leading this kind of lifestyle or if a prediction says you won t get pregnant in the next five days do you trust it and who is taking responsibility for the consequences we need to design technologies to not only collect data but also present it in a way that makes sense and that addresses diverse users data needs and to let users understand their data instead of over trusting it we did a fertility technology study and found the technology implicitly placed both physical and emotional burden on individuals trying to conceive many apps were following social norms making the women not their partners track the data but is that really the right way to do it so that s part of the challenge we need more experts who can connect both the technical side and the medical health side to create better healthcare technologies dutt one of the biggest challenges is finding how we move from episodic event based medical care to a model that s more integrated holistic and proactive this requires us to personalize the model to the individual spanning not only biomarkers to show if you re at risk for say heart disease but also the mental health aspect breaking down siloed healthcare to deliver integrated services will be critical this challenge transcends computer science and goes to the root of how policymakers and the government look at and fund healthcare in society if you look at how we re trying to achieve this vision of empowering people and developing personal models we can do that in smaller pilot studies but achieving it in practice is a huge challenge the other major barrier is privacy which varies not only from person to person but also very importantly as a person s health condition changes i m a healthy young adult and i m invincible so i don t want to share my data but you take an aging individual and there you get into all kinds of issues maybe in principle they don t want to share their health information but because of their condition they might need to maybe they re suffering from dementia it s a very complicated issue so how can we develop policies and infrastructures that can manage the privacy requirements of healthcare as the health state of an individual changes over time that s a very interesting aspect that colleagues here including professor sharad mehrotra have been working on nan again focusing on statistical research in health one of the greatest challenges in the next five years will be better understanding deep learning ai algorithms and being able to do some sort of reliable statistical inference on those models deep learning algorithms have been very successful in many areas of health research especially in radiology there are many interesting examples of the machine doing better than even the best trained radiologists when you have huge amounts of data you can train the algorithm to do more precise diagnoses but one challenge from the statistical side is trying to understand the effects of the predictors for example the risk factors to a disease statisticians build simple models that are easily interpretable but deep learning algorithms are usually a black box type of thing we don t really know what s going on inside the black box the algorithm can usually achieve a pretty good prediction but we still need to understand it more in order to find modifiable risk factors to improve people s health or to gain knowledge of disease mechanisms so we ll need statisticians and computer science researchers working together to open the black box finally what research will you be focused on in the coming year chen i m going to continue focusing on data driven technologies and examining the data work of individuals engaging in their everyday health practices we re doing a project on asthma with one of my ph d students imagine you have an inhaler that tracks your locations and notes where you take medications and senses certain environmental variables so how do individuals their caregivers and their healthcare providers benefit from such data and how can we design the right technologies to support their data work increasingly these data driven technologies are coupled with ai to provide algorithmic advice such as suggestions or predictions if the app tells you when and where you are more likely to have an asthma attack would you trust and follow such a prediction how do you make sure that the ai is accurate so i think on both the clinical and patient sides that s a really interesting direction i ll be working on including as it relates to smart health technology such as the smart diaper that tells you when it needs to be changed or the smart app that predicts your fertility window or tells you when to feed your baby increasingly society which is enthusiastic about data and ai is going to push for changes in how we manage our health and lifestyles so we need to make sure these technologies are designed properly dutt some exciting projects are in the works through the new institute for future health ifh we talked about unite and mental health and another area is food because what we eat can affect our mood and our physical health so a new line of research we ve started looking into together with professors ramesh jain and amir rahmani in the school of nursing relates to the new topic of food computing another ongoing effort is in pain assessment where we are trying to quantify the level of pain for subjects who are not able to communicate such as people just coming out of surgery or neonatal infants this will help doctors and nurses determine whether to administer pain medication and how much we re doing a small study with the uci medical center looking at some post operative patients to create a baseline and build a model using facial monitoring and measuring facial muscles and sweat and heart rate it s very exciting finally using data sets that we can access through the uc system we re doing covid detection intervention and prediction studies so it s quite a portfolio of projects and i am really excited that i m at uci it s a pleasure to wake up every morning and work with all these really bright people nan my personal research is on aging in general and alzheimer s disease in particular one of the problems i m thinking about is how to estimate alzheimer s disease prevalence a challenging issue is in survival analysis which is my field of interest the commonly used mathematical models implicitly assume that people can live forever you don t say people have to die before age 150 even though that s what we observe in the real world in fact that kind of modeling assumption is very hard to handle for aging studies which focus on the end of life so the idea i m proposing is to look at people who have already died to see who developed the disease during their lifetime and who didn t where the lifetimes are finite that s clearer information trying to understand during a lifetime who developed the disease when it happened and how it relates to certain risk factors it s natural to ask the question in a forward way how many people will get the disease in the next five years but my way of thinking is also going backwards looking at people s entire lifetimes to hopefully provide more precise estimation about this disease and a better evaluation of risk factors this is a new framework totally different from what people have been doing in the past and hopefully it will lead to important discoveries shani murray uci launches new professional program master of data scienceamstat news celebrating women in statistics 2021 annie qu

for the men s tournament the model sabin developed gave villanova a 50 1 chance to win the championship over north carolina people don t realize that 50 1 and 49 9 are essentially the same thing statistically they ve very similar explained sabin regardless the prediction running along the bottom of the espn channel had villanova with its 50 1 favored to win when you work in sports you start having these rooting interests that have nothing to do with anything rational admitted sabin who had no ties to either school and didn t really care who won yet based on his model espn had predicted a villanova win so he suddenly became very invested in that outcome i have never been more nervous than i was at this moment he replayed the moment he was referring to during the webinar transporting viewers to the final seconds of the 2016 championship just as north carolina tied the game well my model was very close 50 and the game is tied with five seconds left he recalled thinking at the time that s what the highest probability was this outcome but i also wanted people to not lose trust in me villanova then won the game with a buzzer beater basket the game had an incredible finish said sabin and the espn prediction had been correct there s more to the story including a statistical twist and lessons learned so if you re affiliated with uci be sure to watch the recording with your ucnet id during the webinar sabin also talked about how it was sports that really generated my love of statistics in the first place and he explained how using sports analogies helped him make sense of difficult concepts in college when he couldn t grasp the idea of n dimensional space he thought of it in terms of having five different variables and trying to predict the outcome of a game it s easier to understand concepts if applied to a passion like sports he said which he views as opportunity for introducing new students to statistics i m a big believer that using sports can help increase diversity in stem education guindani similarly views sports as a potential recruitment tool it s an area that provides opportunities for getting students excited about statistics leveraging sports webinars for recruitmentsabin s talk was one of a series of webinars offered by the sport statistics group recordings of the other webinars are available online with your ucnet id career paths in statistics with luke bornn co founder and chief scientist of zelus analytics recording data and statistics in baseball what it s like to work in a baseball analytics department with kevin ferris of the boston red sox and richard anderson of the cincinnati reds recording and watching sports through the eyes of a statistician with hal stern of the department of statistics recording as noted earlier the next webinar will feature brendan kent of draftkings and creator the measurables educational sports analytics and sports tech podcast while a ucnet id is required to view recordings of previous events the live webinars are open to anyone from high school students exploring potential majors and career options to professional sports analysts or even international statisticians visit the events page for log in information however the long term goal of these webinars is to help recruit a dedicated group of uci students interested in working on a variety of projects related to sports stats the hope is that students after watching a webinar will get involved with the sport statistics uci group any uci students can join the group all ics students are welcome as well as students who might be majoring in a different field e g economics or psychology says guindani it would be awesome to put together a group that could eventually collaborate with uci s athletics

capstone course in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics was in 2009 with 19 students from the department of informatics working on five project teams now more than a decade later the informatics capstone course is offered three times a year and ics has added undergraduate capstone courses for its computer science and data science majors it also offers capstone courses through its master of human computer interaction and design mhcid master of computer science mcs and master of software engineering mswe professional programs even with the global pandemic moving people out of classrooms and offices and into online spaces this past year more than 130 ics capstone projects were successfully completed tremendous growth we re growing in leaps and bounds says informatics professor hadar ziv who led that first capstone course so many years ago this growth was on full display at the ics spring 2021 capstone student design showcase where nine of the 12 projects presented were a mere sampling of the more than 60 projects completed for the undergraduate informatics computer science and data science capstone programs this year you can view many of the student capstone videos online it was hard to select projects for the showcase because they all were very competitive says professor sergio gago masague who led the new computer science capstone and its 16 projects after a successful pilot version last year the course has already grown from 50 to 70 students and gago masague plans to scale it up again next year the capstone required for the data science major the first such undergraduate degree program offered in the uc system resulted in 14 projects created by 42 students this year the course is co taught by two faculty members each year one from the computer science department and one from the statistics department the balanced and rigorous curriculum of the data science major allows students to take on a wide range of ambitious capstone projects ranging from predicting medical treatment effects using electronic health records to using time series techniques to forecast product demand stresses statistics professor vladimir minin who directed the data science program the last three years starting july 1 2021 statistics professor mine dogucu will take the helm of the program the other three projects presented at the capstone student design showcase were award winning designs from the butterworth design competition a software development competition open to ics students the top prize and 10 000 was awarded to the grasshopper fund a startup marketplace and funding platform ics has also witnessed growth at the graduate level with the mcs spring 2021 capstone showcase featuring 18 different projects one of which armory took third place in the butterworth design competition mcs students working on the armory interactive platform which lets developers experiment with various cybersecurity threats so they can proactively write secure code were awarded 3 500 this year another seven projects were completed for the mhcid program and a joint mcs and mswe winter showcase in december presented 46 projects ten of which were created by the inaugural mswe cohort of 34 students quantity and qualitythe growing number of projects isn t the only impressive element of the ics capstone program the quality of the projects is also increasing says jason king associate director of corporate relations in ics we re seeing more success stories on both the student and sponsor side as we refine the capstone process and devote more time up front to setting up the projects this benefits the students faculty and corporate sponsors we re not just doing projects to do projects he says we re ensuring students gain the hands on experience and soft skills needed for future success ziv agrees a couple of my teams were not only the best in their class but among the best i ve taught in 12 years or so he said referring to the adventure biofeedback project where students created a game environment to make speech therapy for kids fun and the dreams for schools project where students helped a nonprofit stem education program scale up its operations the game environment for the adventure biofeedback project in developing the speech therapy application computer software engineering major eduardo magdaleno said it was an opportunity for him to apply all of my culminated skills that i learned during my four years at uci he was able to practice agile development project management hci and more while working closely with the stakeholders i did demos and user testing and learned that talking and eliciting the right questions was very important so our application could be built with the users in mind informatics major stella adriana who helped design an instructor assignment sorter for dreams for schools similarly talked during the showcase about how the project helped her learn how to effectively communicate with developers google software engineer tim laubach one of more than 120 participants at the online capstone student design showcase stressed the importance of the students learning this lesson the most beautiful design in the world if it can t be implemented doesn t help the user gaining this practical hands one experience is what the capstone courses are all about there are things we just can t teach in a traditional classroom the capstone course gives students a leg up as they transition out of their undergraduate degree and into their careers says informatics lecturer matthew bietz who taught one of the capstone courses this year even those who already have a background in industry have a lot to gain from the capstone experience working on this project has expanded my knowledge of agile development and working on a team which will be significant in my career progression says mcs student uddeshya kumar who worked on an artistic photos application to help people create art from photos this project gave me the opportunity to learn new technologies that align with my professional goals and will prove to be crucial in the near future a presentation of the artistic photos application the project sponsors are yet another beneficiary of the capstone courses project sponsors tell me again and again how happy they are to have worked with the students says bietz some sponsors come from nonprofits and just this quarter our students built apps to help victims of trafficking to support parents of children with developmental disabilities and to help cancer patients better understand their treatment using 3d visualization to name just a few he says some sponsors join us from startups or larger tech companies and in addition to creating marketable products working with the students is a way to identify individuals they want to recruit this form of networking is invaluable to students and sponsors alike for all of the skill building and new knowledge the students get says bietz the real impacts of the capstone program lie in building relationships careers and passions if you are a company interested in sponsoring an undergraduate or

second ever virtual ceremony nevertheless represented something extraordinary the class of 2021 will have a unique place in our institutional memory as the most resilient and responsive class we have ever had the privilege of teaching said chancellor howard gillman during his opening remarks under the most extraordinary circumstances you rose to the occasion supported each other adapted and persisted as gillman lamented the physical separation of the occasion instead of the traditional gathering in the bren center he emphasized that no matter our physical circumstances we are right now anteaters together marking this great moment in your life graduates of the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics heard a similar sentiment from dean marios c papaefthymiou in his welcome for the ics ceremony ics expects to confer more than 1 200 undergraduate and 100 graduate degrees this year although the hybrid nature of this commencement is not as gratifying as an in person live ceremony the significance of the event remains as strong as ever said papaefthymiou as the class of 2021 transitioned from students to graduates joining a network of more than 10 000 ics alumni papaefthymiou spoke of their larger role in society our aspiration is that you re graduating from our program equipped to make a positive impact on our world using technology to do good and leading in creating a better future for everyone four student commencement speakers then recalled their anteater journeys starting with tiffany kong although kong has already secured a position as an engineer at qualcomm she admitted that she had no intention of graduating with a bachelor s degree in computer science when she first came to uci i never really thought about working in the tech or software industry let alone majoring in computer science but i did know three things i enjoyed math i enjoyed art and i really wanted to attend uci she told her fellow classmates through computer science i came to enjoy a variety of topics such as ai and hci because they provide a perfect blend between art and design and math and technology she spoke of both the devastation she felt after failing ics 32 as well as the courage she mustered to successfully retake the course for me failing a class seemed like a nightmare or even now for us graduating into a pandemic it s hard to get out of that doomsday mindset she said however this is what has made us stronger all these challenges that we have gone through have proven to us that we have never let doubt consume us similar to kong software engineering graduate jennifer kwon also found her passion at uci after taking a project management course my time at uci has brought me invaluable skills and i couldn t have asked for a better experience here she said she was driven to succeed taking courses over summer to continue her learning her senior capstone class provided one of her most memorable experiences as she conducted a research study in collaboration with the children s hospital of orange county to make speech therapy fun for kids the project was recently highlighted during the ics spring 2021 capstone student design showcase kwon had this advice for her classmates class of 2021 be fearless kind and optimistic anteaters computer science and engineering graduate ming hua lawrence spoke of the tremendous challenges he faced in his journey to this moment born with autism i m so grateful today to receive my bachelor s degree after studying for five and a half years he said noting that learning algorithms and programming c and systemverilog was especially difficult for him requiring more than twice the time needed for other students yet he persevered i truly feel that any goal is possible if we put our mind heart and soul into it he told his classmates my biggest wish today is to encourage you whether autistic or not to always have hope kindness and perseverance so the highest purpose can be reached first generation low income latino student francisco loya spoke of the resilience of this class of 2021 in particular a bird sitting in a tree is never afraid of the branch breaking because her trust is not in the branch but in her own wings said the computer science graduate the students who have gone through uci before us have passed tough classes met great people and graduated each and every one of us has done the same but have done so while assisting sick family members getting internships and job offers rescinded and fighting for equality he noted so yes we are now graduating with a degree but the strongest asset we ve proven that we have is grit and a strong work ethic the class of 2021 is indeed unique in having overcome the yearlong upheaval caused by the global pandemic each graduating student whose name was read with pomp and circumstance playing in the background as their slide flashed on the screen has their own story of overcoming challenges in earning their ics degree particularly during their final year in the program yet each and every one showed great determination in reaching this moment and will forever share a special place in history as that most resilient

machine learning it also serves as a great learning tool for uci students thanks to the second annual ml hackathon a student competition funded by the national science foundation the uci research community donated nine challenge datasets from the repository for the event and the research cyberinfrastructure center rcic provided the computational resources we wanted to create a fun opportunity for students to engage with real projects within the uci research community says tamanna hossain a graduate student in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics who organized this year s hackathon my favorite part of the event was definitely the enthusiasm and curiosity students brought to the table especially under the difficult conditions of the ongoing covid 19 pandemic ten teams participated in the virtual hackathon held may 14 through may 23 2021 and competed for the top prize of 500 for best overall and for four 250 prizes awarded for technical skills scientific insights creativity and best presentation yu miyauchi award winning hacksthe top prize went to hatomugi an ml model designed to detect fake reviews on yelp developed by data science major yu miyauchi the model leveraged the yelpnyc challenge dataset which contains 359 052 yelp reviews for restaurants in new york city miyauchi who graduated in june and is now a data analysis consultant at deloitte says this competition was a great way to simulate my future work yu miyauchi explaining his machine learning model for fake review detection in yelp qingchuan yang yihan wang another hack using the yelpnyc data was aces2alliance which won the technical skills award data science major yihan wang and computer science major qingchuan yang applied deep learning algorithms to predict whether an unlabeled yelp review was real or fake i was not expecting to win the award at the end says wang but i am grateful to ics for giving the current students a platform to showcase the skills we have learned yang added that it was exciting to apply ml theories learned from lectures to practice and see how powerful they are andrew chen the award for scientific insights went to i am a segmentation fault developed by computer science major andrew chen using the dataset containing climate change and ecosystem carbon information in california i created a regressor that predicts carbon densities in california based on projected temperature and precipitation conditions he says this event was a great opportunity to use the theoretical machine learning skills that we heard about in class on real world data sets richard lopez and rionel dmello the most creative hack was two truths and a lie developed by computer science majors rionel dmello and richard lopez given a misconception and tweet pair our goal was to detect if that tweet propagates the misconception allowing content moderation on social media the students used the covidlies dataset of approximately 6 000 tweet and misconception pairs and fasttext a shallow neural network to extract word embeddings i enjoyed working on a project that was so closely related to the pandemic and i understand the challenges that big tech faces in regard to reducing the spread of misinformation says dmello my partner and i also had to come up with innovative ways to communicate and share information over various platforms which was a challenge in itself lopez agrees working on a covid related project in the middle of the pandemic was quite an adventure randy huynh top left ruslan manahoran top right and william hou another hack using the covidlies dataset was wtawtaw which won the presentation award for this hack first year computer science students randy huynh and ruslan manahoran along with first year data science student william hou focused on characterizing common covid 19 misconceptions and developing a model to detect their presence covid 19 has had such a huge impact on our lives and all around the world and it was really interesting to explore how rampant covid 19 misinformation is on the internet says the teammates through our research we were able to determine commonalities between misinformative tweets such as word and phrase choice types of misinformation certain themes etc we hope our project will contribute to the development of more robust misinformation detection models in the future advancing ml researchin addition to the competition the event included ml research talks by computer science professor sameer singh and computer science ph d students sam showalter anthony chen dylan slack and gavin kerrigan singh chancellor s professor padhraic smyth and rcic director philip papadopoulos served as faculty mentors throughout the event and because all of the projects completed were open source the hackathon work contributed to ml research as well this is an amazing opportunity for undergraduates not only to gain hands on experience with applying machine learning to real problems which can really help them get jobs in machine learning but further working on scientific problems offered by uci faculty means that the undergraduates are helping advanced research i wish i had such

emerita jessica utts august 20 2021 this summer professor emerita jessica utts of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics was recognized with two prestigious awards highlighting her tremendous contributions related to the field of statistics george cobb lifetime achievement awardin june utts attended the 2021 u s conference on teaching statistics uscots as she participated in the online event she was unaware that a clock and tribute book were hidden behind a chair in her home office she learned of the items only after the consortium for the advancement of undergraduate statistics education cause announced her as the recipient of the 2021 george cobb lifetime achievement award in statistics education the award is presented biennially at uscots to an individual who has made lasting contributions with a broad impact and as outlined in her nomination letter jessica s work in the statistics education community is second to none utts has authored two bestselling textbooks for introductory statistics seeing through statistics first published in 1996 and now in its fourth edition and mind on statistics with robert heckard first published in 2001 and is now in its sixth edition she has held leadership roles that influence both collegiate and high school curriculum and has been a passionate advocate for statistical literacy for all publishing papers that outline what educated citizens should know about statistics even in retirement she continues to be in demand as a speaker with her most recent theme being data science ethics i was of course honored to find out that i had won but the most astounding part was the collection of letters that comprised the nomination packet and the assortment of photos testimonials and memories in the tribute book says utts i will be forever grateful to the nominators for the work they did in creating those documents and amazed that i didn t find out they were doing it jessica utts finds the clock hidden in her home after learning she had won the george cobb lifetime achievement award in statistics education according to the written testimonials utts has changed the face of statistics education and is internationally respected forward thinking visionary one person spoke of her influence on k 12 and collegiate education in the united states while another noted that as the first female statistician i had ever met you have been a role model for me yet another summarized her work as follows over the past forty years you have demonstrated excellence in teaching a variety of forward looking statistics courses innovated in creative ways published a number of foundational articles and textbooks that continue to shape the field and engaged in professional service to help foment change as the nominating letter concludes we marvel at what she has accomplished and she has done it all with humor grace and an enthusiasm that is contagious the dinsdale awardone month after receiving the george cobb award on july 27 2021 utts received the dinsdale award from the society for scientific exploration sse she learned of the honor at sse pa connections 2021 a joint online conference between the sse and the parapsychological association pa established in 1992 the award named after tim dinsdale recognizes significant contributions to the expansion of human understanding through the study of unexplained phenomena it aims to reward senior scholars who have significantly contributed to our understanding of anomalous physical biological and psychological events in the spirit of meticulous research exemplary methodology and proper scholarly attitude utts received the award for significant contributions in the rigorous application of statistical methods to the study of psi shorthand for parapsychology including remote perception presentiment and distant healing i was delighted to have my work recognized by receiving the dinsdale award and was particularly pleased that the awardee immediately preceding me was hal puthoff who first introduced me to this research area says utts who met puthoff many years ago at an see conference puthoff was the director of the government funded research program studying psychic abilities and their possible use for intelligence gathering he was looking for a statistical consultant for a program based out of sri international utts became a consultant for the program and still collaborates with parapsychology researchers to this day about half of my research publications are related to my work in parapsychology she says noting that her most prominent work was a report she put together for congress my work was a part of the full report evaluating the government work on psychic abilities commonly referred to by one of its code names stargate she says that report led to appearances on cnn larry king live and lots of other media outlets the dinsdale award appropriately spotlights how utts leveraged her ph d work in statistics and her undergraduate study of both math and psychology to push the boundaries of mainstream science and advance the field of parapsychology all while continuing to advance statistics

professional goals december 8 2021 women have been historically underrepresented in stem and that trend continues today the pew research center found that women make up 25 of computing occupations and girls make up approximately 30 of ap computer science test takers girls and women face a number of challenges in the stem field which is why uci s master of data science program aims to make stem more accessible to underrepresented groups our goal is to diversify the field of data science and break the mold we want to increase female representation in tech and also help improve social mobility for underrepresented groups in the u s mds program manager bryan mu oz said the mds program launched in fall 2021 welcomed 25 students in its inaugural class of 2022 thirty two percent of the first mds cohort are women one of them being adelynn paik who serves as one of five mds program ambassadors as ambassadors we act as representatives of the program to prospective students and potential company partners paik said we are also the first point of contact for many applicants so i hope to be a welcoming face for all to prospective mds program female candidates seeing how women like paik can thrive in computing fields is inspirational because they see how they too belong in stem having leaders and programs that strive to make stem more inclusive also helps change discriminatory attitudes that women often endure from not being taken seriously to experiencing sexist policies my challenges as a woman in stem started with two discrediting high school math teachers and have taken a number of different forms since then paik said i think the worst part is when the misogyny cannibalizes your mind and you start to make yourself small even without a perpetrator it takes work to choose not to be bitter or afraid some days more than others and to re center yourself in your own path in her position as an mds program ambassador paik hopes to contribute to the efforts to make the sciences more welcoming and supportive of women i can be part of the normalization of women excelling in this program especially in its infancy she said alongside making data science less unfamiliar to potential female students another goal that paik wants to achieve in the mds program is expanding her knowledge of data science while developing a burgeoning focus on one specific field paik s interest in data science comes from her longtime passion for stem particularly math and her undergraduate education at the massachusetts institute of technology mit she majored in systems engineering within mit s civil engineering department and received her degree in 2021 paik was also involved in two research groups at mit work of the future and glaciers group the first was the work of the future task force which was an interdisciplinary effort to analyze the impact of increasing automation on future jobs my mentor and i investigated automotive startup activity by collecting both qualitative and quantitative data paik said i was also briefly part of the glaciers group where i used computer vision to track the longitudinal movement of a glacier front as someone who decided to study systems engineering because she wanted to learn about how people move and live paik said the research she conducted at mit reflects her interests in the realms of city development transportation planning and the environment she added that her systems engineering education at mit which was rooted in mathematical and technical material translates well to her current graduate school education data science seems like the swiss army knife of majors in its applicability across fields i cannot think of an industry that doesn t make use of data in some way paik said at uci s mds program i m gaining useful skills while giving myself the chance to learn about the job landscape through offerings such as career counseling and the capstone project when paik isn t playing around with numbers you can find her taking classes on improv at the groundlings theatre school where she s a two time diversity scholarship recipient or doing stand up comedy i love that communal feeling of being in a cramped dimly lit room telling jokes to an audience and hanging out with other comedians as an asian american woman i find it s a great exercise in taking up space and defying the label that we are subservient she said what marries together the realms of comedy and stem for paik are how they empower women of color to be loud and let our talents represent us the optimism initiative and passion that paik has in her academics hobbies and beyond are sure to help her achieve her goals in the mds program in the short term i look forward to claiming a specialty within data science and starting a career in the environmental transportation healthcare or entertainment industry paik said my long term goal is to remain hopeful and work on projects with people i respect and admire karen phan disney

news seminar center for statistical consulting tech trends for 2022 january 10 2022 ics professors daniel epstein mohsen imani and tianchen qian discuss their research and the technological developments they expect in the coming year the new year starts with healthcare front and center as covid 19 continues to impact people s daily lives throughout the pandemic the fields of computer science informatics and statistics have all played an important role in helping people move their lives online stay connected and analyze vast amounts of data for informed decision making how will these fields continue to advance virtual and augmented spaces find new ways to bring people together and improve healthcare analytics and interventions in the coming year here to answer these questions while covering an array of topics including artificial intelligence ai wearables the aging population mental health and cybersecurity are three professors from the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics daniel epstein assistant professor of informatics and leader of the personal informatics everyday pie lab studies personal tracking technology and designs devices and apps that help people better track everything from health and fitness to finances and productivity mohsen imani assistant professor of computer science is working on a wide range of practical problems in the area of bio inspired computing machine learning computer architecture and embedded systems tianchen qian assistant professor of statistics works to develop methodology to understand causal relationships through the analysis of highly complex data with applications focusing on health and wearable technology the unique structure of ics as a standalone school with three departments computer science informatics and statistics makes it the perfect environment for exploring all aspects of computing and technology and the impact on society let s see what technological developments these three scholars expect to see in 2022 what technology advances are you most excited about as we head into 2022 daniel epstein epstein far from my area of expertise augmented reality has only recently become viable on people s everyday phones while i m skeptical that it will revolutionize the way we communicate with one another i m hopeful that it will help us create richer experiences once we find the right niches where the technology is really valuable i m also excited to hopefully see us take all of the big advances in conversational agents into important areas where people find them useful current research says they re mainly just used for setting timers and playing music my student lucas silva has been examining how voice assistants can make food journaling less burdensome and fit in with everyday technology use like using an alexa instead of your phone to log what you just ate while your hands are busy doing the dishes mohsen imani imani this pandemic has proven that virtual reality vr is an essential technology for our future communication vr will make significant changes in how we communicate with computers and each other it will shorten physical boundaries by giving us virtual feelings besides vr i am also excited to see the next generation of wearable devices and health monitoring technologies that could change the quality of healthcare systems tianchen qian qian i m most excited about the advances in wearable device and sensor technology and in particular their increasing applications in healthcare with these technology we are getting better at detecting the state of an individual such as stress level and location and potentially delivering behavior change interventions to them in real time this provides ample opportunity to improve health but also brings a lot of challenges such as how to balance the therapeutic effect of the interventions and the burden of receiving interventions through smartphone and wearable devices what is the next big challenge you think society will face and how will your field help epstein covid 19 forced us to radically restructure how we live and work with one another while there is certainly some appetite to return to normal for many people normal was worse or wasn t good either i think the big challenge for society is thinking through what changes for the better emerged from our situation and how do we not lose those in a foolhardy attempt to wipe the memory of the pandemic from the vantage point of informatics i particularly see us helping out in understanding how technology helped move activities that were in person to online and advocating for the things that became better from being online everything from online education to telemedicine to how people socialize with one another imani we face increasing needs for efficient and real time processing for diverse cognitive tasks using a vast volume of generated data deep learning and ai are predicted to make evolutionary changes in many areas including healthcare finance and cybersecurity to extract useful information applications often rely on sophisticated and costly machine learning and ai algorithms that lack transparency robustness and have long latency and high power consumption for realistic intelligent and effective systems to be developed and deployed there are crucial needs for scalable learning and computing methods on embedded devices for example algorithms that now run on large scale data centers with kilowatt power consumption need to be processed in real time on our daily used smart devices for example a smartwatch and smart glass this requires fundamental changes on the algorithm and underlying hardware qian the current one is obviously the pandemic which my colleagues have thoughtfully commented on the next big challenge in my view is the aging population and how to improve the quality of life for the elderly with longer life expectancy and lower birth rate the composition of the age pyramid is transitioning toward an older population and there are many challenges ahead how would the society take care of the elderly when a large proportion of the society are themselves old how can we empower the elderly with modern technology so that they can enjoy their lives without the assistance of another human for a longer period of time how can their quality of life be further improved while respecting the inevitable decline in physical and mental capabilities my collaborators from uci mind and i are investigating the early signs for alzheimer s disease and other cognitive disorders we are looking at the data from uci s 90 study where hundreds of individuals over 90 years old have been followed for years and have has their cognitive performance assessed over time we hope to identify features that can be used to predict cognitive disorders and bring new insights into the process everyone will face aging how is your field affecting people s day to day lives epstein in my mind informatics is at the forefront of taking technology advances and seriously thinking about how they can should and even shouldn t impact people s everyday lives in my specific area of personal health we re understanding how people feel about the well being technology they use every day and are testing out new ideas for improving those technologies based on research we ve seen health apps like apple health move from showing people pretty boring bar graphs of how much they walk each day to more useful insights and trends we ve also seen apps improve since earlier work in 2017 how they support people of more varied identities and goals such as menstrual health apps better supporting transgender and non binary individuals and all people across their health lifecycle some changes might feel subtle but they go a long way toward helping people get the health support they need from technology imani my research on hyperdimensional computing hdc aims to redesign algorithms using strategies that more closely model the human brain this new direction is an alternative paradigm that mimics important brain functionalities toward high efficiency and noise tolerant computation hdc is motivated by the observation that the human brain operates on high dimensional data representations hdc incorporates learning capability along with typical memory functions of storing loading information hdc has shown several advantages as the next generation of cognitive machines to enable human like intelligence first instead of requiring many iterations and data points for training hdc can learn in a single iteration from just a few examples second hdc operations are highly parallel and lightweight thus empowering online learning on our daily used smart devices finally hdc has a natural robustness to noise which is essential for current unreliable network and hardware technologies qian i would like to talk about the elephant in the room which is having a huge impact on people s day to day lives right now the covid 19 pandemic statistics has played an important role in our society s joint effort to combat covid 19 enabling us to efficiently and appropriately use data to make informed decisions it has helped us monitor cases model disease spread develop vaccines and assess their effectiveness establish guidelines on dosage and boosters and predict the future trajectory of the pandemic to guide policymaking what industry will experience the most changes based on computing advances in the next five years epstein like every year recently the question is which industries won t be heavily impacted by computing advances closest to my work i m expecting we ll reach an inflection point where healthcare takes more seriously what patients are experiencing outside of their clinical visits we re already seeing telehealth and messaging a doctor systems being widely available and used but i think we ll start seeing these systems extended to include more options for care for example at home covid tests have become big and i wouldn t be surprised to see those sorts of records be better digitized and structured to support population health but i also expect other industries will be seriously changed too imani there is no doubt that all industries will experience major changes using emerging ai techniques but i will highlight two in particular healthcare and cybersecurity ai powered health monitoring technology can help doctors prioritize patients and provide urgent care to those in the most danger thereby saving lives in addition such technology for example in the form of a lightweight wearable device like a bracelet also offers a convenient method for patients to monitor their own health ai technologies are also stepping in to help improve cyber resilience as security issues have started presenting a day to day struggle for businesses attackers are getting smarter so our cybersecurity must grow smarter too it is essential to deploy effective cybersecurity technology based on future machine learning algorithms with higher intelligence efficiency and human like reasoning capability qian i think one of them would be healthcare our healthcare model is transitioning from episodic event based care to integrated preventative and holistic care the advances in computation and ai are among the key facilitators for this transition with the rapid advances in wearable technology more and more people will be able to get care when and where they need it the most and i m not just talking about physical health mental health is an equally important aspect and its care stands to be greatly transformed by technology advances imagine someone who is trying to quit smoking wearable sensors nowadays allow us to use prediction algorithms to detect in real time when a user is stressed a big risk factor for relapse in smokers furthermore we now have the capability to immediately act on this real time prediction through digital interventions delivered through the wearable device or a smartphone such as recommending a mindfulness exercise to the individual to help reduce their stress level all these can be done without the involvement of another human being these type of smartphone and wearable based health interventions are also being developed in various other domains such as physical activity bipolar disorder substance abuse and so on i can only imagine how many more there will be in the next five years to transform healthcare and people s well being what research projects will you be focused on in the coming year epstein together with my students i m focused on moving people s health tracking practices beyond individual apps or experiences and into the complex circumstances where people use technology for example supported by an icts pilot award my student eunkyung jo is planning to bridge the gap between health data that patients collect and how doctors use that data we re planning to develop ways to annotate health questionnaires that your doctor might give you to fill out at home like symptom logs with your own data two of my other students dennis wang and xi lu are looking at what role social media should play in helping people get support and advice around the health data they collect and understanding why apps like myfitnesspal and weight watchers don t seem to be enough to serve those goals supported by snap research we ve been working on using data to help people who are meditating together become more aware of each other s mental states imani we aim to explore alternative computational models that enable further energy scaling by abandoning the deterministic requirement of today s computing systems these approaches will be particularly effective in the realization of cognitive functions such as recognition decision making and learning these functions are gaining rapid importance in a world that is infused with sensing modalities and in need of efficient information extraction qian my research focuses on the experimental design and statistical methods for developing mobile health interventions in particular i aim to develop efficient methods to utilize wearable data in order to answer the question of when where and under what context should a mobile health intervention be delivered one of the projects i will be focusing on in the coming year is a collaboration with professor pathik wadhwa from the uci school of medicine and other colleagues where we aim to develop just in time adaptive interventions for reducing stress among pregnant women and women of childbearing age this project involves building a prediction algorithm for detecting real time stress designing a micro randomized trial to collect data and constructing the algorithm to deliver the interventions in an optimal way on a more personal note what is your new year s resolution and is there anything from your bucket list you hope to cross off in 2022 epstein yikes big question i picked back up trail running this fall and did a few races for the first time in a while so my big goal there is to stick with staying active imani after two years of pandemic and remote working i believe it is finally the time to explore the world i am so excited to use summertime to travel with my family as helen keller once said life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all qian i just had a newborn in the summer of 2021 one of my new year s resolutions is to spend more time with my son and my family to cherish the moments when he is so little and so adorable

list of resources including on campus groups here at uci we also list some nationwide organizations and books that focus on diversity and race in technology as well as spotlight some black leaders in computer science and engineering both on and off campus when we think about black history month we usually begin by acknowledging those who have come before us and who are often overlooked in our society says gregory diggs yang assistant director of the stacey nicholas office of access and inclusion oai we should always honor those trailblazers but we should also recognize those great contributors who are currently widening the trail and those who are just beginning down it created in 2014 oai is a joint office between ics and the henry samueli school of engineering focused on recruiting retaining and graduating talented students from historically excluded populations the following is not meant to be an exhaustive list stresses diggs yang but rather a starting point for reflection during black history month and a way to recognize current black visionaries and new pioneers i am excited to be acknowledging the current unsung heroes of black history as it is being made creating a supportive campus culturewe start with a list of organizations at uci that are focused on supporting the black community the black faculty staff association bfsa provides a sense of purpose

alliance for minority participation is cutting edge and explores the environmental factors causing minoritized students to leave stem adams is also highly engaged in activities to increase the number of black high school undergraduate and graduate students pursuing stem fields black history month is very important to me says adams it s a chance for reflection on the strength of my ancestors which i channel into my research teaching and service i strive to be my ancestors wildest dreams and to influence the next generation of black engineers also in the samueli school of engineering assistant professor of biomedical engineering timothy downing is leading a team of interdisciplinary researchers working to uncover the molecular and physical principles of epigenome replication the project is funded through a 3 million nsf grant for research that seeks to better understand the dynamic nature of the epigenome which will open new possibilities for cellular engineering the award will also support activities that broaden participation in science among high schoolers and undergraduates including students from underrepresented groups in addition downing received 2 million in funding for a 2019 new innovator award with this work he aims to shed light on how mechanical cues integrate with and give rise to disease driving epigenetic mutations ultimately leading to the discovery of better treatment options for cancer patients black history month is a great opportunity for us all to reflect and remember to bring our full self into the edges of the social networks that we live and work in says downing it represents the idea that there s space in our society for everyone to exist and participate authentically when we do that incredible things happen in the school of ics assistant professor of informatics roderic crooks studies the intersections of race technology and public life his current project explores how community organizers in working class communities of color use data for activist projects even as they dispute the proliferation of data intensive technologies in education law enforcement financial services and other vital sites of civic concern the pursuit of science including information and computer sciences does not exempt anyone from participation in the complex dynamics and shared histories of anti black racism in the united states and across the world says crooks we are all deeply enmeshed in systems of power and privilege that benefit some and harm others based on interlocking hierarchies of citizenship wealth race class gender sexuality and disability i am encouraged by the increased willingness of our students to name these dynamics and to consider the study of structural oppression central to the work we do in ics also in the school of ics is ian harris who has been a professor in the department of computer science since 2004 his research interests include the design of secure hardware and software systems and the application of natural language understanding to security and design his current projects include the detection of phone based social engineering attacks the formalization of natural language specifications and the development of a cyber test range to evaluate the security of iot systems he is also leading a team of students participating in the mitre embedded capture the flag competition joni ricks oddie is the first full time director of the uci center for statistical consulting and is also director of the institute for clinical and translational sciences icts biostatistics epidemiology and research design berd unit by managing both ricks oddie who earned her ph d in epidemiology from ucla in 2012 has streamlined processes so the two groups operate in sync as a one stop shop for the uci community and affiliated organizations needing to collaborate with a statistician she works with a variety of organizations including chapman university and children s hospital of orange county and has organized many training sessions and workshops at uci she has a heart for working on diversity equity and inclusion dei related projects and is currently helping to lead the icts black thriving initiative strategic plan as well as working with faculty in the statistics department to expose underrepresented minority urm middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science every few decades our nation has a crisis of conscience as it pertains to its black citizenry says ricks oddie we change policies enact new laws develop diversity initiatives and commit to do better unfortunately each time the situation or crisis that initiated the movement ultimately gets forgotten and society moves on to some other more fashionable issue i truly hope this time we do not get weary in well doing and are able to sustain our commitment to making uci a place where black people are truly able to thrive and be their authentic selves shani murray 4 ics professors among 7 uci

endeavor that marries uci s powerhouse health sciences engineering machine learning artificial intelligence clinical genomics and data science capabilities to deliver the most effective health and wellness strategy for each individual person and in doing so confronts the linked challenges of health equity and the high cost of care the institute will bring a multifaceted integrated approach to what many call the next great advancement in healthcare precision medicine collects patient data history exams demographics molecular and diagnostic tests and uses the power of computer algorithms predictive modeling and ai to develop personalized treatment and lifelong health maintenance plans what we re doing at the institute for precision health is perhaps the most important step we ll take in this generation to improve health and well being said steve a n goldstein m d ph d faap uci s vice chancellor for health affairs the ever evolving capabilities of the iph herald a future of personally tailored care that fundamentally alters the healthcare landscape to place the patient at the center and in control in the past individuals were treated based on approaches thought to be best for groups of patients now we begin the iph epoch of patient centric care designed to continuously improve the health of the individual within their community even as new knowledge accrues whereby rights incentives transparency and control remain the purview of the patient goldstein added iph is an ecosystem for collaboration across disciplines that comprises seven areas smart statistics machine learning artificial intelligence designs software to integrate and analyze health records molecular data and observations the unit is led by daniel gillen professor and chair of statistics and zhaoxia yu associate professor of statistics a2ir applied artificial intelligence research designs practical solutions to real world clinical problems for cost effective value based care it is led by dr peter chang assistant professor of radiological sciences a3 applied analytics and artificial intelligence brings solutions to inpatient ambulatory and community settings and

by suzanne sandmeyer professor of biological chemistry and leslie thompson donald bren professor of psychiatry human behavior and neurobiology behavior collaboratory for health and wellness powered by syntropy houses the dynamic analytics platforms and patient controlled data at the core of the iph ecosystem the group is led by tom andriola vice chancellor for information technology and data and kai zheng professor of informatics deployable health equity employs machine learning artificial intelligence into communities to create solutions narrowing the disparities gap in the health and well being of vulnerable populations the unit is led by dr dan cooper professor of pediatrics and associate vice chancellor for clinical translational research and bernadette boden albala professor and director of the program in public health and founding dean of the planned school of population public health education and training with leadership from each area brings courses seminars certificates and degrees in statistics machine learning artificial intelligence omics and bioinformatics to practitioners and students because the disciplines included in iph already existed at uci goldstein noted it was in many ways only a small step to join them together and build a resource across campus the synergy created however is no small matter this is the giant leap for healthcare it s glaringly clear that precision health is how to increase the quality of care to decrease the cost of care by both improving how it s delivered and matching cost to value and to deliver quality healthcare to the underserved he said adding that the institute s success will be measured by improvements in individual and community health a major goal is revealing new approaches to tackle ailments that lack successful therapies for many diseases especially neurodegenerative ones like alzheimer s parkinson s and even huntington s where the causal gene is known there are simply no treatments available that change their course we re excited because we know that with precision health we have the potential to define diseases better understand them better and treat them far better said thompson iph co director we expect major breakthroughs while the vision idea for iph has long been in the works the covid 19 pandemic was a beta test demonstrating how rapidly critical medical needs could be addressed in early 2020 with elements of iph in place uci clinicians biomedical and computer scientists and public health experts joined forces to create an ai driven tool to assess the critical care needs of covid patients this app based tool the covid vulnerability index demonstrated that a data driven approach coupled with world class clinical therapeutics could help yield the best outcomes for individuals we couldn t have had a proof of concept with higher stakes than the pandemic said tom andriola iph co director we saw in real time how mobilizing our capabilities to analyze health data and make customized decisions could complement leading edge clinical treatments to save lives and reduce hospital stays additionally there is an explosion of data in healthcare and we re still only using a small fraction in decision making he added iph is including not only data from traditional healthcare settings but also the data coming from a new generation of empowered health consumers who are tracking and managing their own health journey the plan is for iph to have a brick and mortar home on the uci campus that will serve as a hub for educating data informed clinicians to practice at the top of their licenses a site for the infrastructure to facilitate translational research a place for community outreach and a venue for commercial collaborations already industry leaders such as syntropy and mitre and community partners such as children s health of orange county and the va long beach healthcare system are working with iph to leverage uci s capabilities and commitment as a fair broker for health data placing individuals first for patients the message is that uci s institute for precision health is the future of your care and well being goldstein said for the research community iph is a wide open opportunity for discoveries that matter for the business community iph is ready to partner to advance new cost effective care and for the philanthropic community the folks

with videos now making up more than 80 of all consumer internet traffic even the smallest improvements in compression algorithms can dramatically impact our ability to store and share information it has been speculated for a long time that neural networks will ultimately revolutionize data compression technologies recently such attempts have proved successful says stephan mandt an assistant professor of computer science and statistics in uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics mandt has been at the forefront of this work our group at uci has been pioneering research into using neural networks to compress data funding from an nsf career award and other nsf grants has supported this work to make their research more accessible the group recently published a survey titled an introduction to neural data compression currently undergoing peer review in april 2022 mandt and his collaborators will present two scientific papers at the international conference on learning representations iclr 2022 a globally renowned conference on cutting edge research in deep learning their first paper advances solutions to a fundamental problem in information theory while the second introduces a new model for general purpose lossless data compression understanding compression feasibilityin towards empirical sandwich bounds on the rate distortion function mandt and his ph d student yibo yang quantify the fundamental hardness of compressing real world data such as images if you ve ever paid attention to the file size of jpeg images you may notice how certain kinds of images take up more storage than others of the same dimensions explains yang it turns out that with information theory we can quantify the inherent compressibility of a given type of data using a quantity called the rate distortion function and no data compression algorithm can beat the theoretical performance limit implied by it therefore knowing the rate distortion function of the data being compressed can really help researchers assess and improve their compression algorithms although the rate distortion function can be worked out mathematically for a few simple data distributions establishing it for other data in general especially for big data of practical interest has been an open research problem with this work yang and mandt move closer to this goal by developing a machine learning algorithm that can estimate the rate distortion function of potentially high dimensional types of data such as images and voice recordings it was really exciting to see the algorithm i sketched out on paper actually work on real world data ranging from natural images and speech spectrograms to data from particle physics says yang such data would have posed an insurmountable computation challenge to the previously known method an algorithm from the 1970s still the general problem is not quite solved and i hope this work opens up new possibilities for future research toward lossless compression with machine learningin hbo s television series silicon valley a group of hackers develops a fundamentally new lossless compression algorithm it turns out that fiction is not too far from reality in a recent collaboration involving anji liu a ph d student at ucla and liu s advisor computer science professor guy van den broeck mandt contributed to a new general purpose compression approach lossless compression with probabilistic circuits published as a spotlight at iclr 2022 the idea of lossless compression is very similar to that of morse code where we abbreviate frequent letters like e by a single dit and rare letters by three dits this leads to an optimally short representation of the message says mandt the key to lossless compression is hence to reliably predict how frequently any given symbol occurs for simple data we can just count but for more complicated data like images we need predictive machine learning models while most neural compression employs popular deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks the present work uses a fundamentally different niche machine learning approach called probabilistic circuits pcs with the help of these models the researchers could dramatically accelerate relevant computations that play a key role in data compression as a result their pc based de compression algorithm runs 5 20 times faster than neural compression algorithms that achieve similar bitrates this work says mandt is a great example of how curiosity driven fundamental research can culminate in surprising unforeseeable applications that would never have been discovered otherwise shani murray uci news uci researchers receive state funding to study pandemic forecasting uci news uci s graduate programs

researchers had developed a hybrid human machine framework for ai systems that can complement human expertise from chatbots that answer tax questions to algorithms that drive autonomous vehicles and dish out medical diagnoses artificial intelligence undergirds many aspects of daily life creating smarter more accurate systems requires a hybrid human machine approach according to researchers at the university of california irvine in a study published this month in proceedings of the national academy of sciences they present a new mathematical model that can improve performance by combining human and algorithmic predictions and confidence scores the seeds for this cutting edge work by researchers in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics and the school of social sciences were first planted decades ago this collaboration started with padhraic smyth chancellor s professor in the computer science and statistics departments and mark steyvers a professor in the department of cognitive sciences padhraic smyth left and mark steyvers stand outside of donald bren hall steve zylius uci one of the really nice things about uci is that there s a lot of interdisciplinary activity says smyth whose research is supported through a qualcomm faculty award there is this culture of collaboration so cognitive scientists come to bren hall to attend our ai and machine learning talks and we go to their talks in fact smyth and steyvers have been meeting periodically since the early 2000s we d chat over coffee about our projects says smyth we speak different languages but we re both interested in intelligence just from different perspectives computer science emphasizes artificial and cognitive sciences emphasizes natural and there s a lot of overlap so when the national science foundation nsf put out a call for research related to how humans and ai work together smyth and steyvers put together two proposals both of which were funded in 2019 one grant focuses on hybrid human algorithm predictions exploring how to balance effort accuracy and perceived autonomy the other grant is an assessment of machine learning algorithms in the wild this work led to the recently published pnas paper bayesian modeling of human ai complementarity as announced by uci the paper was co authored by steyvers and smyth along with heliodoro tejeda a graduate student in cognitive sciences and gavin kerrigan a ph d student in computer science funded by the hpi research center at uci the grants have led to other papers co authored by steyvers and smyth as well they worked with kerrigan on combining human predictions with model probabilities via confusion matrices and calibration a paper appearing in proceedings for the thirty fifth conference on neural information processing systems neurips 2021 and they worked with computer science ph d students disi ji and robby logan on active bayesian assessment of blackbox classifiers a paper appearing in proceedings for the thirty fifth aaai conference on artificial intelligence this line of work is part of a larger collaboration with about five or six ph d students says smyth markelle kelly one of those students is markelle kelly a computer science graduate student who last summer received a fellowship through uci s steckler center for responsible ethical and accessible technology create this year kelly was awarded a fellowship through the irvine initiative in ai law and society both the center and initiative are helping facilitate this interdisciplinary work the human machine collaboration between the cognitive sciences and computer science departments explores questions about how people and machines can work together as a team says kelly who is currently investigating how humans and ai can understand the strengths and weaknesses of each other to better delegate tasks by working alongside cognitive science researchers i can better understand theories about the human side of this problem and incorporate these ideas into potential solutions the resulting cross disciplinary experiments and findings are founded on a much more nuanced perspective than if only machine learning experts were involved smyth agrees computer science historically has been a little bit averse to getting humans in the loop but i think ai and machine learning researchers now realize that although our algorithms have been developed and tested in our labs for a decade or two without attracting much attention they are now being widely applied to address real problems involving real people he says as a consequence getting students early in their career involved in these kinds of interesting projects and in discussions related to how ai is being used will help ensure ai is used

county and other organizations develop grant proposals calculate sample sizes interpret data and design research databases in the deforest park neighborhood of north long beach however the wife and mother of two young children is better known as a community advocate she was recently recognized by assembly member mike gipson as the 2021 woman of the year and she has long helped local residents stay engaged and empowered over the years she has served on the north long beach neighborhood alliance uptown property and business improvement district pbid and citizens police complaint commission cpcc and she is currently chair of the long beach planning commission tackling complex issues such as affordable housing now as ricks oddie campaigns for long beach city council in district 9 her professional and personal lives are growing more intertwined her data driven approach paired with strong community engagement brings a unique skill set and perspective to a platform focused on homelessness economic development and small business recovery public health parks and open spaces diversity equity and inclusion and public safety assembly member mike gipson named dr joni ricks oddie shown here with her husband and two children 2021 woman of the year for california assembly district 64 professional and personal perspectivespublic health is one area in particular that spotlights the interconnected nature of ricks oddie s professional and personal experiences part of my campaign revolves around public health outreach to minority communities and marginalized communities says ricks oddie i want to lead conversations around health equity and funding of public health programs at the city level the pandemic has really highlighted the need for more structural funding for our health department and with my background in statistics and epidemiology i want to bring a more data driven lens to how we make decisions yet ricks oddie isn t only about the numbers as highlighted in a march 7 facebook post about the birth of her daughter chloe the issue of health equity is also personal for her in the post she recounts how she gave birth to her second child in a car outside the hospital after having been sent home two hours earlier a situation that likely led to life threatening medical complications that left ricks oddie in need of surgery a few weeks later as a black woman i m acutely aware that black babies face a higher than normal infant mortality rate and that black mothers face a higher than normal mortality rate after birth these differences are rooted in the burden that black mothers face due to systematic racial bias she posted as a researcher and academic i deal with data and statistics every day on that day my daughter could easily have become a statistic in the worst possible way in chloe s honor this women s history month i d like to bring greater awareness and respect to those mothers particularly black mothers who literally risk their lives to give birth wrote ricks oddie in a facebook post for her daughter s first birthday ricks oddie goes on to say that this experience was part of her motivation to run for city council one of the reasons i m running for city council is to bring my professional and personal perspective on women s health health equity public health and community health to my work on behalf of our city she is sharing her story to build awareness and to bring a name and a voice to some of the complex challenges facing the city and to encourage others to share their stories as well she credits the black infant health program in long beach with providing her a safe space to process her experience thinking about our healthcare system in totality insurance access care representation and the issues around implicit bias is difficult because these are all things you can t necessarily prove because there are so many dynamics was race a contributing factor these are hard conversations but they re conversations that need to happen data driven solutionsat the same time ricks oddie wants to ensure that any policy changes introduced are not only supported by the data but also tracked and evaluated to properly evaluate programs in the city we need to attach appropriate metrics to assess whether changes made are even working she says i want to advocate for the creation of an office of data and evaluation which would help city departments and staff figure out what data is out there to support a particular position or program change ricks oddie s unique skill set would allow her to help identify appropriate milestones and metrics for policies and then effectively package and visualize them for presentations to the city council and other strategic partners in the city and this approach could be applied to everything from healthcare to homelessness for example she knows from her work with various organizations that it takes an average of 17 touches to persuade someone who is homeless to agree to accept help a lot of community members get frustrated when nothing happens after they make just one call but people have rights you have to develop trust with people and that takes time and resources gathering and understanding the data helps quantify the time and resources needed while also providing important context for continued community engagement from a policy standpoint we really have to think about what resources we provide our health department our social services department and our police department she says because when people call about issues around loitering somebody camping on public property or issues around mental health all of that connects a lot of city departments she stresses the need to manage these different entities at a holistic level while also educating the public about the role they play in helping to address various issues ready to hit the ground runningof the nine neighborhood associations in district 9 ricks oddie has been endorsed by eight association presidents i ve worked with them for the last decade so they trust my opinion and know that i ll be somebody who will always have an open door policy with them and a listening ear she has also been endorsed by both the previous councilmember and by current councilmember rex richardson who is running for mayor they also know that i m somebody who will fiercely advocate for our community i already have a lot of relationships going in which will allow me to hit the ground running she says and while her professional background brings a high level of analytical skills and expertise to the table it s her ability to apply those skills in support policies that will actually improve people s daily lives that matters i tell people i m raising my family here and i want them to live in a community that they re proud of where it feels like their city and their city leaders care about their well being shani murray applications open for new uci summer biostatistics

will be offering a two week session titled data data analytics theory applications from july 25 to aug 5 high school students will be on campus monday through friday from 9 a m to 4 p m exploring the foundations of data science with real world hands on projects computer science is more than just programming the whole idea behind the summer academy is to offer a selection of courses to help high school students explore the various areas and topics that comprise the ever changing and growing field of computing explains computer science professor magda el zarki the director of the academy leading this effort we re starting off with this one course on data analytics it is a great way to launch the program given the tremendous interest that students have in data it s the big thing these days camp attendees will spend their days in the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci learning about data science methods and concepts through hands on projects using anonymized health data from actual patients the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci mornings will start with lessons from professor babak shahbaba of uci s department of statistics or from professor sam behseta of cal state fullerton s department of mathematics they will be teaching students how to collect process summarize and visualize data after a daily lunch break highly qualified and trained uci graduate and undergraduate students will lead small teams working on projects related to actual datasets often drawn for biological and medical sciences the teams will make predictions using statistical models test scientific hypotheses using statistical inference techniques and make decisions under uncertainty by applying statistical thinking for the students it will be exciting to work with actual datasets and see what it s like to make sense from databases comprising a jumble of numbers and more says el zarki students will learn how to manipulate the data make the models analyze their results and present it in a way that illustrates certain interesting conclusions it will be an eye opener for a lot of kids students will also get to tour the campus visit research labs in the school s departments of computer science informatics and statistics and explore career pathways in the many related fields of computing interested students must apply online by may 6 2022 the application is short but does require the name title and email address of a teacher principal or school administrator who when contacted can submit a letter of recommendation also by the may 6 deadline there is no application fee and the 2 500 program cost covers lunches snacks and all materials required ics will provide laptops with all the software needed for the course the first cohort will likely be around 30 students the plan is for the ics summer academy to grow in offerings and cohort size the goal for next year is to offer three or four courses eventually building up to around six to eight courses by 2025 serving up to 250 students each year i m very positive about this effort for the future because i think it s very different from anything else out there says el zarki we already have faculty really interested in covering other areas the focus of future sessions might include security game development the internet of things iot ai and machine learning quantum computing and more there might also be more advanced sessions on certain topics for those interested in learning more about a particular field the goal of the summer academy is to help students explore and get a better understanding of what it means to be a computer scientist and the exciting careers that one can pursue being one says el zarki we want to give them a good sense of the diversity and vastness of the field of computing all the areas of expertise and knowledge that it encompasses and that make it so exciting shani murray dr joni ricks oddie applies data driven lens

discussing everything from chocolate milk to dating apps and referencing shows like parks and recreation and rupaul s drag race an open access book co authored by mine dogucu removes barriers to learning bayesian statistics and finds new ways to engage readers i sincerely believe that a generation of students will cite this book as inspiration for their use of and love for bayesian statistics says duke university professor yue jiang in his review of bayes rules an introduction to applied bayesian modeling crc press 2022 this is perhaps the most engaging introductory statistics textbook i have ever read that was the goal when mine dogucu an assistant professor of teaching in uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics started collaborating with alicia a johnson and miles q ott on their bayes rules book which is freely available online or can be purchased from crc press as a hard copy paperback or e book a preprint by the authors outlines their commitment to accessibility and inclusivity while writing the book we wanted to make bayesian statistics more accessible for undergraduate students everywhere particularly novice learners says dogucu and for diverse groups of learners from different backgrounds to accomplish this they deliberately included a wide variety of entertaining examples and exercises as joseph k blitzstein of harvard university notes in his foreword you will encounter a vibrant sample of applications in this book ranging from weather prediction to lgbtq anti discrimination laws and from who calls soda pop or calls pop soda to how to classify penguin species most importantly careful study of this book will empower you to conduct thoughtful bayesian analyses for the data and applications you care about not surprisingly dogucu herself first became passionate about statistics after seeing its real world use in an application area she cared about what first sparked your interest in statistics i was a math major in a small liberal arts college statistics back then was not as popular especially for the small school and there was no statistics department per se it was within the math department i decided to take a statistics class and i remember very well the moment i decided i wanted to study more statistics we were working on a dataset about hurricane katrina about housing losses and damages and i was so impressed i thought wow we can actually use math to answer useful questions of course useful means something different for everyone but for me it means helping people so using statistics to understand problems impacting people was so fascinating to me and that s when i decided i needed to take more steps to study this why is there now a need for books on bayesian statistics targeted at the undergraduate level bayesian statistics itself is not new but traditionally it has not been taught widely there are many reasons for this one reason is that it is computationally challenging second in the past there were more criticisms surrounding the subjectivity of bayesian methods it s becoming more popular because we now have greater computing power and the scientific community or part of the community has reevaluated subjectivity more schools are offering a bayesian course now another reason is that there are two big paradigms in statistics one is frequentist and the other is bayesian so if we don t teach bayesian we are not really giving our students the full picture of different approaches to statistical analysis also there s this key value that is almost always reported in scientific studies the benchmark p less than 0 05 the p value is overused and often misused in studies experts argue that when writing a whole scientific study it shouldn t all come down to just the p value and one of the suggestions in the field of statistics is to make more room for bayesian methods the american statistical association put out a statement on p values and it starts with a quote about why colleges teach p 0 05 we teach it because it s what we do we do it because it s what we teach so if we actually teach bayesian methods that s one way to help break that cycle it brings an additional perspective to statistical analyses beyond the p value we have to prepare our students for that how is uci s department of statistics preparing students i recently co authored a preprint on the current state of undergraduate bayesian education and we were looking at courses across the nation in the highest ranked 100 universities and 50 liberal arts colleges we found 46 institutions that offer a bayesian course but most of these were elective courses only four institutions required bayesian statistics and uci is very special because we were one of them we offer an undergraduate course every winter stats 115 introduction to bayesian data analysis and it s a required course for our data science program so it s not surprising that this course is accessible at the undergraduate level at uci we have many famous bayesians in our department including hal stern wes johnson michele guindani veronica berrocal and babak shahbaba so ics is just a good bayesian place and we re also collaborating with other schools for example as part of a recent nsf grant cal state fullerton will start offering a new course like ours you wanted readers to find people like themselves in the book how did you achieve that goal so we assume that our readers will have diverse backgrounds because we started with our own students and our own students have diverse backgrounds but at the same time we aimed for this book to be accessible to everyone you don t necessarily have to be an undergraduate student we wanted it to be relevant to different cultures for instance there s an example taken from u s elections with presidential candidates going through primaries although other political systems might have primaries it s not universal so to use that example we had to give the context so we tried really hard to read the book from different perspectives to make it as accessible as possible to a diverse group of learners from different backgrounds what is one of your favorite examples from the book one part of the book that i really like is the statistical model evaluation and the reason for that is because at least in the books i used to read as a student myself model evaluation mostly focused on statistical numbers for example some model evaluation criteria that we would calculate but in our book in addition to that we also focus on ethical aspects of statistical models like is the model biased how were the data collected how could the model impact individuals or society at large i really like that this is included in the book how do you think the field of statistics might change based on greater diversity and inclusion this book is not the only thing that s going to make our field more diverse i think it might create small changes like a reader might see one example in the book that they connect to or an instructor might be inspired to make their materials more accessible but these are all small water drops in the bucket of course our aspiration is to have a bigger impact on the field but that usually comes from institutional changes like providing access to more opportunities for students in addition to affordability you also made the content accessible for people with visual disabilities yes we made sure to use color blind friendly color palettes in addition the online version of the book supports alternate text that is image descriptions read by screen readers alternate text not only makes images accessible to the blind and visually impaired but also to everyone because for instance they show up in internet searches to the best of my knowledge bayes rules is the first statistics e textbook that supports alternate text and you were deliberate in whom you cited in the book and how you cited them why unfortunately the way citations work is that usually we cite people who are already cited a lot we don t go out of our way at least i didn t before writing this book to pay attention to why i was citing someone so in preparation of the book we tried to read more authors from diverse groups to make sure we were including different points of view and that s not just for the book but to benefit us as educators by reading more then we wanted to make sure the book captured all those different scholars we also paid close attention to citing trans authors correctly actually my first quarter here at uci i cited an article on transgender scholars in my blog on inclusivity before even realizing tess informatics professor theresa tanenbaum was here in my school but basically we tried really hard to check their websites so we didn t just rely on how other people cited them finally what informed your decision to make the book open access this was of course a mutual decision with my co authors and their reasons might be similar or different but from my perspective textbooks are unaffordable as a student i was on a textbook scholarship from my school so i could buy books through that luckily here at uci we even have students who have food insecurity i wouldn t want to say to them don t buy food buy my own book especially considering that students actually contributed to the book maybe not by writing it but i ve been basically using some drafts of it for three years my students found typos and helped me see what examples were most effective and i learned from their responses to the material so they were actually part of the writing process which makes it unreasonable to ask them to pay for it i don t know the exact numbers but hundreds of people are accessing the online book on a daily basis from many different countries so it s been a great decision if students cannot access the book they cannot learn from it so accessibility was our number one goal i don t think a print book would have reached as many readers shani

31 2022 the uci master of data science mds program held a q a style panel discussion on april 21 with industry leaders in data science this discussion was held in collaboration with the southern california r users group socal rug a local forum of people who use the statistical programming language r bella feng sep dadsetan and john preach were the featured panelists along with ryan benz the three of them shared their experiences working in the data science industry focusing on their career development over the years career growth bella feng the first question of the night was how one can stand out at work and form positive relationships with their colleagues bella feng head of statistical programming and clinical trial data science at biotechnology company eqrx started the discussion by encouraging everyone to be engaged and open minded feng mentioned that she got her first job because of a presentation she did at a statistical analysis system sas conference to feng it s important to build strong relationships with those around you because they can pay off in the long run in your career sep dadsetan sep dadsetan who is the executive director of real world evidence analytics at healthcare and artificial intelligence company concertai agreed with feng and emphasized the significance of knowing the structure of your company and how you interact with your colleagues to understand the impact of your role it s really important to send an email introduce yourself and try to connect with others and see what they re working on dadsetan said i think through that you ll see where you can contribute and how the company is organized john peach in addition to networking john peach principal data scientist at cloud technology company oracle and member of socal rug says using data to inform decisions and be customer focused while keeping the company vision in mind can improve your work performance and relationships with your clients for data scientists one of the big parts of the job is to be a trusted adviser your job is to help the people that make decisions make the decision that s based around what the data is telling them as opposed to what their gut says peach said make sure that what you re going to do has some real impact along the way and you should be able to identify everything that you re doing and what the impact is going to be like for the customer biotechnology company seer s director of data science and socal rug member ryan benz led the latter half of the panel s discussion on career growth with a lighting round to discuss career growth and pitfalls ryan benz benz and the panelists noted that being curious dependable and a problem solver and having people skills are signs that an employee may be ready to be promoted when asked to share some examples of what might set back professionally they said being indecisive and having a limited or negative mindset may hurt you to avoid stumbling in your career peach re emphasized looking at the bigger picture and advised performing at the level you want to be promoted to and taking ownership of your work management vs individual contributor career tracksthe panel discussion shifted to focus on two career tracks being a manager versus being an individual contributor peach described one of the differences between being a manager and an individual contributor being the scope and type of their responsibilities while individual contributors manage themselves and are responsible for their projects a manager s role entails managing people such as overseeing personnel and creating teams in that sense being a manager is almost like being a parent according to feng dadseten added that good managers understand the scope of their own knowledge and skills and will help you find the support you need if they cannot personally provide certain resources the panelists then discussed how one knows if being a manager or an individual contributor is the right role for them understanding how you want to manage your impact at work is one thing to consider to give an example peach noted that being a technical leader allows you to have an impact throughout your organization but your impact is still focused on your area of expertise on the other hand a manager will have a broader impact on both projects and the people they re guiding as you re going up the ic individual contributor track ask yourself if you are enjoying the project management aspects more than you re enjoying the technical hands on work peach said that s a good indication that maybe taking on some management role would be interesting to you being a manager also gives you more influence in the workplace which is one of the things feng enjoys i really like the influence part said feng adding that she championed the use of r in a previous role but was unsuccessful because she was not a decision maker so once there was a reorganization my initiative was killed because everything was outsourced but right now i m not an individual contributor and more like the decision maker so i can decide dadsetan said that as you progress in your career it s good to take note of what you like and dislike and what you re good at and not good at because these are all factors that come into play when deciding what role you find best fits you i think it s important to realize that it s not a decision you have to make now and can never go back to ever dadsetan said there s relatively fluidity balancing personal professional lifecareer advancement inevitably comes with more expectations and responsibilities that can even interfere with your personal life benz said that managing stress and experiencing burnout are not talked about enough even in school so the panel discussion ended with everyone sharing how they handle the demands of their careers dadsetan acknowledged that you might hit the ground running straight out of college but it s imperative you don t overwork yourself and start drawing lines as needed as an individual you have to balance being fresh out of school wanting to make a good impression wanting to do your best so that might require you to work overtime dadsetan said but it s also really important to be listening to your body and know what it is that you want to prioritize in your life and take stock of what matters to you setting boundaries at work is also a way that feng maintains a healthy work life balance in the past she juggled a number of roles and responsibilities all at once at work causing her to burn out feng said attending a weeklong retreat and connecting with herself without electronics helped her recover and be more in tune with her body another way to prevent burnout is by learning to separate your personal and professional life it s a job it s not my identity peach said for a very long time my self identity was tied to what i was doing making that separation has helped a lot it can also help to find purpose in your career so that you are moving up learning new things and specializing rather than being stuck doing the same tasks or trying to do everything at once i personally am much better if i know that i m having personal growth i m learning a lot peach said focus on where your talents are as you go up in your career you re going to be more and more specialized in what you re known for so focus on doing that as opposed to doing everything karen phan don t think you can learn bayesian statistics think again with bayes rules qu elected international statistical institute member quick links news archive

expo held in the new state of the art interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb the event was a culmination of months of hard work offering the students the opportunity to present projects completed for undergraduate capstone courses in informatics computer science and data science as well as for the butterworth product development competition project sponsors and students alike look forward to this annual opportunity to highlight projects they ve labored over throughout the year students presenting their work in the iseb lobby at the ics project expo partnering with industry the expo really ties together the four foundational elements of engagement that our programs offer project experience entrepreneurship mentorship and opportunities for internship says jason king senior associate director of corporate relations in ics the expo benefits project sponsors looking to recruit and showcases all the great work of our students these ics undergraduates spent anywhere from 10 to 20 weeks experiencing hands on learning working on real world projects collaborating with industry partners peter colligan a senior technology executive for the sap s 4hana industry cloud was one of 40 industry professionals in attendance at the expo speaking of sap s goal of helping to accelerate collaboration between academia startups and industry colligan stresses the importance of these types of events i get a chance to directly and informally interact with student teams and talk about the engineering skills and projects they care about those discussions can sometimes go deeper where professors themselves step in and get a chance to highlight and validate ideas and common challenges with industry practitioners he continues very realistic and concrete outcomes have come out of this such as ideas for future capstone projects full time employment work or joint industry research initiatives jason king thanks the corporate partners gaining real world experiencerecognizing the tremendous benefits of providing opportunities for practical application and industry engagement the department of informatics has been offering a capstone course for more than a dozen years it is now a graduation requirement for informatics and ics has also added elective undergraduate capstone courses for computer science and data science majors presenting your work professionally in a conference like event is a very valuable experience for our undergraduate students says computer science professor sergio gago masague who launched the computer science capstone course in 2020 i personally enjoyed watching students and sponsors engaging in very interesting discussions about projects and ideas for future work one of the top computer science capstone projects leveraged artificial intelligence to create a personalized recommendation system for quick service restaurants qsrs for the ai driven personalized menu content for the qsr drive thu project students ezra hammond rieko konishi arian namavar and ryan sakuma partnered with delphi display systems they developed a machine learning system that presents relevant items to users based on their preferences and dietary restrictions to improve the drive thru experience they also presented their project and competed at the national capstone design conference in dallas texas on june 6 2022 the capstone project gave me the confidence that after my four years of education under the school of ics i am ready to tackle new and unfamiliar projects successfully and implement what i ve learned says namavar who graduated in june during the interviews i had with various companies i would always answer their questions with my experience with our ics capstone sponsor and project in mind which i think helped me secure an offer namavar will be working as a software developer at nisum the ics expo was also a great opportunity to present our project and take ownership of our result seeing the progress other students made was another aspect that made me proud of ics informatics lecturer darren denenberg was similarly impressed by the students progress noting that everyone was able to achieve something great with their capstone but he was most surprised by the audioscribe project by alexis diaz ellen kulla jinli duan qiantai duan and yuan wang they did a project on cough diarization says denenberg it was a project i thought no one would be interested in and it ended up being one of the best groups best projects and they also went to dallas to compete in the national capstone conference professor denenberg left and ics dean marios right listen to students pitch their products informatics professor hadar ziv attended the conference with the audioscribe team and says they represented themselves and the school of ics very well they really held their own conducting multiple high quality presentations and enjoying their interactions with their peers and with capstone instructors from around the country however even students who don t have space in their schedule for a capstone course or conference or who aren t upperclassmen have opportunities for entrepreneurship thanks to the butterworth competition this product development competition is designed to encourage the creation of new technologies with the potential for commercialization this year s winning project leprendo was on display at the ics project expo letting participants view the online farmer s marketplace created by computer science major dylan riffle computer science and engineering major kanu chandra business administration major dan ta and psychological sciences major nina nguyen by developing our pitch deck and going through the competition we learned the importance of being able to combine the technical development of a product with business development and communicate this effectively says riffle the team will continue to develop leprendo over the summer we re firing on all cylinders and increasingly promoting the value of capstone projects showing why regional and national companies should be involved with these programs and the talent pipelines they offer says king our programs are

some of the benefits of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics aside from the fact that it s the only computing focused school in the uc system and happens to sit in the middle of silicon beach it also offers capstone courses that provide hands on experience in a practical real world environment the strength and importance of such programs was reiterated june 6 8 2022 when ics faculty students and staff attended the national capstone design conference in dallas texas i came away from the capstone design conference even more convinced that providing hands on practical experience is essential to prepare our students for life after college says informatics lecturer matthew bietz during his projects in human computer interaction capstone course students take all of the skills they have learned in ics classrooms and put them together in the context of a software development project these projects require students to balance real world priorities deadlines and resource constraints they have to understand client needs and figure out how to best meet them given their team s strengths and weaknesses he explains our capstone program gives our students a real competitive edge in the job market this year some of the top students from the ics undergraduate capstone program with course offerings for informatics computer science and data science majors traveled to dallas to present their projects at the same time ics faculty and staff learned about and shared best practices uci students taking a break from the conference to explore plano texas sharing best practicesone goal of the biennial capstone design conference is to provide a forum for sharing ideas it features sessions focused on how to engage industry partners bring in dollars for philanthropic support manage courses and so on the conference gave us the chance to find out what is working and not working at other schools learn about tools and techniques for organizing and teaching capstone courses and network with colleagues says bietz it also gave him the opportunity to share some best practices from ics collaborating with informatics professor hadar ziv who has been leading capstone courses in ics since 2009 bietz co authored a paper for the conference on empowering capstone students in client interactions they point out in the paper that most student training has been in classroom settings where the structure of tasks is well defined the expectations are clear and the instructor is an absolute authority they argue that a critical lesson gained from the capstone experience is learning how to have a productive disagreement with a client ziv also co authored a paper with colleagues from texas a m and from brazil on adapting scrum ceremonies in undergraduate capstone projects the paper talks about getting student teams to follow agile values and principles and scrum activities and best practices while acknowledging important differences between a scrum team in the real world and undergraduate students in a capstone course these were just two of the more than 30 papers and posters presented at the conference ziv also presented two workshop sessions in collaboration with uci alumnus david ochi director of the beall student design and butterworth product development competitions the workshops covered how to generate ideas and how to translate projects into startups ics had a strong showing at the conference not just by the number of papers posters workshops and other activities but also by a strong attendance and active engagement with all other attendees says ziv our presence was well noticed and well received jason king senior associate director of corporate relations in ics agreed noting that it was a win win situation we attended this conference hoping to take away some golden nuggets or gems learning from other institutions he compared it to being an athlete seeking out better competition during training if you truly want to grow and be the best soccer player you need to get outside of your region to compete against other players to raise that bar and this is a perfect example of that he explains this is the first time we ve gone outside of our region and it s only helping us grow now we re opening up those communication channels and people respect our feedback and vice versa presenting projects and networkingwhile half of the conference focused on best practices the other half focused on student engagement with students competing presenting and networking with their peers and also meeting with high school students interested in computer science and engineering our students who attended the conference were amazing says bietz presenting their projects in a competitive poster session was a great learning experience and they got great feedback from the judges and other attendees the conference also provided an opportunity for them to network with students from other schools meet representatives of tech companies and strengthen their bond with each other connecting with other students was a highlight for jessie chang a business information management major who presented her team s project canvas tools for teachers the tools she helped design aim to alleviate common challenges in the existing education model i enjoyed meeting new people the most there were so many different teams from different parts of the countries she says it was just really cool meeting them and learning about their projects she added that she learned a lot about engineering the conference seems more geared toward engineering students so it was a surprise to all of us that our projects were even accepted as it was all software king noted that the conference is making an effort to incorporate more computer science students and projects into its biennial event the capstone conference in dallas was a fantastic opportunity to showcase two quarters of hard work as well as engage with students and professors from all over the united states says software engineering major ellen kulla who presented the audioscribe cough diarization project with teammates alexis diaz jinli duan qiantai duan and yuan wang audioscribe developed in a capstone course taught by informatics lecturer darren denenberg analyzes different sounds for use in clinical research and healthcare settings the conference adds kulla really showed us how much students are able to accomplish as a group in a short period of time jason king front right with audioscribe team members another ics project presented was developed by computer science students ezra hammond rieko konishi arian namavar and ryan sakuma the students collaborated with delphi display systems in a capstone course taught by computer science professor sergio gago masague to develop a recommendation system for quick service restaurants qsrs my team had the opportunity to attend the conference and it was an amazing experience getting to represent the school of ics and interact with sponsors companies colleges and universities from all over the u s and canada says namavar their project ai driven personalized menu content for the qsr drive thru uses a machine learning system to present relevant items to users based on their preferences and dietary restrictions cultivating that competitive edge the capstone program is the one of the best things about ics showcasing the great work that s going on within the school from undergraduate students says king the program provides opportunities for internships and professional development helps students learn how to apply technical skills and use various project management and communication tools and lets them practice soft skills and networking in a real world environment we want to make sure we re using best practices when it comes to these offerings and that our program is on par if not better than other standout schools across the nation says king this

from july 11 through august 19 2022 twenty three students from around the u s came to uci for the newly launched irvine summer institute in biostatistics and undergraduate data science isi buds the institute is part of the summer institute in biostatistics program offered through the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid this year uci became only the 10th university in the nation to host this free six week summer training course aimed at addressing the growing need for biostatisticians and data scientists offered through the department of statistics in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics the isi buds program provides not only training in the fundamentals of biostatistics data science and computing but also experience in conducting cutting edge biomedical research the main goal is to excite students about careers and graduate school in biostatistics says statistics professor vladimir minin who co directs the program with ics colleagues dan gillen babak shahbaba and mine dogucu careers in biostatistics are peculiar in the sense that a lot of them require a graduate degree so there s a need for more training in this area explains minin however biostatistics is rarely taught at the undergraduate level so many undergraduate students do not know about career opportunities in this area sarah schlund a senior at uc santa barbara double majoring in statistics and data science and in geography agrees i had been searching for an opportunity to gain experience in biostatistics prior to committing to a five year doctorate program in the field however such opportunities are few and far between she says isi buds offers the rare opportunity to gain biostatistics experience as an undergraduate and learn from the very impressive faculty at uci who have immense biostatistics knowledge and experience both in industry and academic research ics faculty members and the inaugural cohort of students for the irvine summer institute in biostatistics and undergraduate data science an impressive inaugural cohortthe inaugural cohort of students selected from more than 150 applications came from a wide variety of schools including the university of connecticut emory university montana state university the university of arizona university of michigan university of vermont and university of washington there was also a regional presence with students from uci uc riverside uc santa barbara and ucla the highly competitive program includes up to 500 in travel expenses free housing and a meal plan or a 2 500 stipend as well as 600 for incidental expenses the cohort was also a diverse group of students with almost 40 coming from groups that are underrepresented in the quantitative sciences we were able to recruit a significant number of students from historically excluded backgrounds with the hope of increasing diversity in the field of biostatistics says minin that was a very important goal because many are first generation college students who typically lack information about graduate school and about the many career options open to them the program included career preparedness activities including a workshop on the grad school application process and a q a with ph d students and outlined classes that students should take to have a more competitive application making this information available to everyone levels the playing field a little bit explains minin people from pharmaceutical and biotech companies including uci data science graduate jessica george came to talk with students about careers in the biotech industry in addition communications coach bri mcwhorter gave a two hour workshop on how to present scientific information helping prepare students for their research presentations on the final day of the program karren messer who is a professor and chief of the division of biostatistics at the herbert wertheim school of public health at uc san diego gave a talk and offered students valuable feedback on their presentations it was a very impressive group of students says gillen chair of the uci department of statistics they came in and within six weeks they did three weeks of courses both on technical and soft skills and then they jumped right into three weeks of real research pounding out an amazing amount of work and giving wonderful presentations at the end of it real world research a smashing successstudents attending the program started with lectures and labs conducted by six different instructors and a statistics ph d student teaching assistant learning how to design and analyze clinical trials model infectious disease dynamics and analyze big data in genomics transcriptomics and imaging the students came from various backgrounds so we spent the first three weeks making sure they were all on the same page in terms of their technical knowledge says minin we devoted this time to checking off all the boxes of what they needed to know for their research projects students then worked under the supervision of research mentors in addition to statistics professors gillen minin and shahbaba the following also served as mentors louis ehwerhemuepha manager of computational research choc research institute lauren gyllenhammer assistant professor of pediatrics uci daniel parker assistant professor of population health and disease prevention uci elizabeth read assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering uci and pathik wadhwa professor of psychiatry human behavior uci the real heart of the program was the research projects and that was only possible because of the dedication of the biomedical scientists whom we asked to participate says minin it was a smashing success because of their engagement with the students in addition four statistics ph d students provided invaluable support to the teams during the project phase of the institute the research covered the following topics analyzing the impact of maternal stress volatility during pregnancy on child health outcomes predicting maternal stress during pregnancy understanding movement patterns of farmers and forest workers from the thailand myanmar border conducting a spatio temporal analysis of melioidosis cases in lao people s democratic republic uncovering gene gene interaction motifs from single cell transcriptomic data and assessing associations between congenital conditions and covid 19 severity in children i was motivated to apply to this program because i was thrilled to get my hands on some real world biomedical data do collaborative research and learn from world class experts in statistics by means of the uci department of statistics faculty says dante ramirez an undergraduate majoring in statistics and minoring in bioethics at the university of washington what i liked best about the program was the opportunity to collaborate with like minded statisticians in a clinical research setting working with a cohort of statisticians and data scientists with relatively homogeneous skills in this setting and being guided by statistical mentors is such a special opportunity in learning my own strengths and weaknesses how to effectively communicate and work with others and how to do contemporary clinical and quantitative research although ramirez had originally intended to go straight into industry after graduating he has since changed his plans the isi buds program convinced me to apply to a biostatistics or public health graduate school program as this would make my goal of transitioning into a public health regulatory position much more attainable the research groups have some fun after giving their presentations left vladimir minin pink shirt and right dan gillen blue shirt with their student groups exploring so calboth ramirez and schlund were impressed by the research experience gained as well as by the ability to enjoy some downtime and explore southern california i was pleasantly surprised with the culture of the department and how plentiful the weekend activities were says ramirez as they were very conducive of bonding between my cohort and meeting various graduate students schlund agreed the professors also made large efforts to get to know us personally outside of dedicated lecture and research time they planned and attended weekend events that included kayaking whale watching hiking etc she says every professor in the program has been exceptionally personable kind and genuine to every student in the program summer 2023isi buds has secured funding for a minimum of five years so planning for summer 2023 is already underway registration will open in march 2023 and you can visit the application page for more information we want to make sure that we re feeding a diverse pipeline for the stem fields in general but also for biostatistics and statistics says gillen so we re going to continue to grow the program we hope that it becomes a hallmark of the department to be able to attract bright students into the graduate programs not just at uci but for many programs this is a great way to introduce students to biostatistics shani murray professors nan and gillen receive 1 8m grant to study statistical methods for alzheimer s researchsocal data

complex data analysis this demand is the backdrop for the socal data science program a collaborative effort between faculty from uci california state university fullerton csuf and cypress college aimed at recruiting training and dispatching a diverse workforce of stem and data science majors led by statistics professors babak shahbaba and mine dogucu of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics and mathematics professor roberto pelayo the program is funded through a national science foundation grant preparing a diverse workforce via academic and industrial partnership with 1 5 million in funding across the three institutes and over the next three years the goal is to recruit 120 fellows from the three campuses offering targeted coursework and hands on training research opportunities and career development workshops the program is off to a strong start with 32 fellows selected from a pool of more than 200 applicants this diverse cohort is 87 women and students from other historically underrepresented backgrounds having such a diverse and strong group of students is amazing says shahbaba that was one of the goals of the program students and faculty of the socal data science program during the winter and spring this first cohort of students took data science courses developed through the socal data science program and offered at uci csuf or cypress college then the students put their new skills to the test with a summer research project rigorous training at summer bootcampprior to starting the six week research project students attended a one week bootcamp at uci the topics covered included exploratory data analysis advanced r programing and generalized linear models we had students coming from different backgrounds and fields computer science statistics biological sciences and we wanted to make sure that before they started doing research they had the required skills says shahbaba the bootcamp brought everyone together in terms of research preparedness the students really helped each other and worked well together the bootcamp also included a session on ethics in data science as well as training in professional and academic development we focused on more than just data science covering resume writing and interview skills says shahbaba and we invited graduate students to talk about their experiences in grad school real world research experienceonce the bootcamp ended students broke into several groups with each group diving into a real world data analysis project it was six weeks of intense research says shahbaba they were on campus at least three days a week from 10 a m to 4 p m working in the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci designed for collaborative research it s such a well designed space for these kind of projects it made our collaboration with the industrial and academic partners very smooth and productive students collaborating

sensing chrs the fleischman lab the fortin lab and the reich lab the program was an amazing experience for me because it really gave me a chance to apply skills i learned from my courses to real world problems says program fellow giles pierre carlos a data science major at uci i was able to apply the techniques i ve learned and build significant models for an extremely interesting area of neuroscience research at the undergraduate research symposium on aug 4 2022 the last day of the summer program carlos and his teammates presented their work on understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of memory their project modeling nonspatial sequence memory task using neural decoding leveraged data provided by dr norbert fortin and the fortin lab at uci the program was collaborative in nature and because of that i learned how to solve statistical problems in a team setting says carlos on top of that the program solidified my interest in obtaining a master s in statistics and even made me open to going for a ph d in the future overall the program made a huge impact on where i want to take my career alyssandrei parinas who is studying computer science at cypress college and

september 22 2022 in july 2022 the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics welcomed hengrui cai as an assistant professor of statistics can you tell us a bit about your background and how you decided on statistics i m originally from southeastern china and i m the only child in my family growing up my mom and my grandma encouraged me to be independent and to seek a career i would enjoy and fight for my entire life when i took the exam to go to college i got full marks in mathematics this gave me the confidence to choose a mathematics related major as an undergraduate student at zhejiang university what inspired me to do a deep dive into the statistics major was the fourth industrial revolution happening during that time related to the realization of society version 5 0 we re in the process of imagining some new society where we will heavily rely on big data to solve challenges and to figure out how people can use artificial intelligence to live better therefore i decided to get a minor in the advanced honor class of engineering education at chu kochen honors college which granted me great opportunities to work with outstanding peers across the university and learn cutting edge technologies to integrate statistics and machine learning elegantly what motivated you to then earn your ph d during my undergraduate i attended several mathematical and machine learning competitions and won the meritorious winner in american mathematical contest yet i could still see my limitations in knowledge which motivated me to reach for the highest standard and become an expert in statistics and machine learning after a summer research internship at the university of alberta in canada i decided to go abroad for higher education and came to the united states after earning my bachelor s degree i spent five years at north carolina state university and got my ph d in statistics under the co supervision of dr wenbin lu and dr rui song my dissertation was on optimal decision making and policy evaluation with complex data which leverage causal inference and reinforcement learning to help us make the right decisions for the right people at the right time during that time i also spent three years interning at amazon that was another excellent opportunity for me to see the real world impact of computer science and statistics and how our research contributes to industry and society can you talk about your research focus i have broad research interests in methodology and theory in causal inference reinforcement learning and graphical modeling and in how they interact to establish reliable powerful and interpretable solutions to a variety of real world problems currently i m working in two main directions one is personalized decision making and policy evaluation for complex data this area integrates the techniques of causal inference and reinforcement learning which enables us to answer counterfactual questions so we can make better decisions in an interactive environment some use cases include precision medicine and personalized recommendations in e commerce i m also very interested in causal discovery with emerging challenges in big data this area leverages causal inference and graphical models to disentangle the complex relationship among variables and deliver the results in an explainable way my long term research goal is to teach a machine to learn the logic from the facts so what brought you to uci first of all i love irvine this city is vivid elegant and multicultural with a lot of young tech companies presenting appealing opportunities for collaboration the second reason is owing to the great research communities inside uci and around the uc system there are so many outstanding faculty members here i would like to work with in my department in the school of ics and across the university also where else can we find the departments of statistics computer science and informatics all in the same school it s a very unique place what courses will you be teaching i will be teaching a course in spring 2023 for undergraduates called introduction to probability and statistics in the future i would like to design some new courses on reinforcement machine learning and on causal discovery is there a book you d like to recommend to students the book of why by judea pearl and dana mackenzie this book is for non technical people who are interested in causal discovery explaining how we understand or formulate causality in real problems and highlighting the difference between correlation and causation it helps us understand the logic of things happening dive into the essence of human thought and use the causal principle as the key to applying artificial intelligence to solve real problems in meaningful ways what do you do in your spare time i like hiking going to the beach and being out in the sunshine i also like to go kayaking and standup paddle boarding if i have a bit more time i like to travel to new places i ve only been in irvine for a few months and i ve already been to las vegas death valley antelope valley and san francisco then from san francisco i drove down the coast to los angeles next i plan to visit san diego and yosemite work hard play hard i enjoy different views which open my eyes and my mind i also like to watch movies to experience different lives one of my favorites is forrest gump hengrui cai at death valley left and along california state route 1 right finally what do you like best so far about uci the people here are so nice i have received a lot of support from my department chair faculty members and department staff during my relocation and onboarding which is extremely helpful for the early stage of my career there are also plenty of opportunities for collaborating and i have been invited to give some talks for example i gave a talk in early september on optimal subgroup identification via constrained policy tree search for choc research i will continue to explore the fantastic research community at and around uci as i study how statistics and machine learning can uniquely contribute to interdisciplinary solutions and i will

of its early graduates uci is where i began my career as a computer scientist and software engineer he said while at uci i met another person who was a graduate student at the time and we ended up working together well into the 1980s you could say uci is where all of my success really started butterworth said he would not have been able to complete his college education without the monetary

long beach city council member watch her inauguration online starting at minute 58 30 as a child joni ricks oddie would often join her grandfather at county commissioner meetings in chicago so it s no surprise that when ricks oddie was sworn in for her new seat on the long beach city council on dec 22 2022 she had her family in tow she took her oath of office with her right arm raised and her left arm holding her young daughter as a wife and mother of two small children it is of utmost importance to me that we make our civic spaces open welcoming and inclusive teaching the next generation the necessity of civic engagement she said during her inauguration speech that lesson starts with them seeing their parents have the ability to be full members and make their voices heard i want to lead by example and let people know families are always welcome in addition to exemplifying her life as a mom in support of family friendly civic spaces ricks oddie also spotlighted her work in epidemiology and statistics in support of more impactful leadership as someone with a science and research background i want to bring data and metrics to the way we make decisions in the city she noted to ensure we are making the most well informed decisions on the ways we invest in our city particularly our most vulnerable communities ricks oddie earned her ph d in epidemiology from ucla and now serves as director of the center for statistical consulting housed in uc irvine s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics she is also director of the biostatistics epidemiology and research design berd unit within uci s institute for clinical and translational sciences icts this professional backdrop gives her a unique understanding of the power of data and as she takes on her new role as council member for the city of long beach representing district 9 she plans to leverage that knowledge to positively impact her community what was the most memorable part of your inauguration the official swearing is at the city clerk s office but the public inauguration ceremony was a ton of fun i had my friend and mentor yvonne wheeler who is president of the l a county federation of labor swear me in and my husband and two kids were supposed to be on stage with me but my son had to go to the bathroom he said he couldn t hold it so my father in law took him as i was giving my speech but it worked out perfectly because my speech talked about the importance of family and children and civic engagement the reason i bring my kids to everything is to make it an inclusive space for families i live in a community of young people of color so we have a lot of families moving in how are we going to grow the next generation of civic leaders if people aren t comfortable bringing their kids so it starts with us as leaders demonstrating that it s okay so just as i finish talking about this and i m shaking hands with some of the other city council members my father in law returns with my son i pick him up and give him a hug and then he says i wanna say something and he grabs the microphone and says hi i m cohen many people thought that was the highlight of the event it was a perfect example of the importance of family and just being a mom in the middle of all that so that was my favorite moment joni ricks oddie holding her son at the inauguration ceremony for the long beach city council how does your position as director of the center for statistical consulting help you in this role at my second city council meeting we announced an emergency declaration on homelessness we have an emergency operation center called the elc and we have around a 100 staff members in long beach dedicated to spending the next 100 days focusing completely on homelessness and sending us reports so the friday before our second meeting is when we got our homelessness report and it was 100 pages i had to read and analyze the report before our tuesday meeting this is the benefit of having somebody with a ph d who is used to looking at data and quickly determining what s happening joni ricks oddie at a city council meeting i ll give you another example there was a slide talking about race and ethnicity related to homelessness because we re trying to approach the problem with an equity lens to identify which racial groups are most heavily impacted in long beach it s african americans so on this one slide there were two data points that just seemed contradictory to each other one was saying that black people tend to spend the fewest days unhoused but they were also vastly more likely to be back on the street 12 months after being housed like 62 compared to the 20 for the next highest group which were white people so what the heck is happening that we get black people off the street quickly but within a year we are back where we started in the meeting i pointed out that this cycle is alarming i then had residents and advocates thanking me for the depth of my questions because i m not sure others had enough time to review the data to make that connection how do your efforts to address the needs of your community give you a different lens for viewing your work in academia it s the importance of implementation we do all this research but we often don t get to see the final dissemination and implementation how do we take what we do and literally translate it into something that impacts people that s exactly what i get the opportunity to do now which is why the work is so important it s basically asking how do you take best practices which is what we re supposed to be doing here as researchers and implement that but then the counterpoint is if we re trying to implement these policies what s the feedback loop to research that s what s missing which is why i think somebody with my background is important to have in a position like this we don t have the feedback loop to know which programs and policies didn t work out the way we thought they would when scaled for a larger audience but having that knowledge can inform how we do our research and create useful interventions you ve said that you want to advocate for an office of data and evaluation why is that important data is great and information is great but what are you going to do with it how can it influence policy and help you apply for grants that can lead to interventions i m hoping to demonstrate to my council colleagues over time that data tells you a story and then based on that story you can present a series of policies to address inequities the level of challenges that we re dealing with right now impresses the need for a holistic view we have to do many things all at once if we re actually going to make an impact which means you need to understand the full breadth of the issue i m building the case right now for eventually hiring a unit of people with expertise in gathering and analyzing data to get the whole story and give us that holistic view ricks oddie on the campaign trail with her daughter in addition to homelessness you also want to focus on health equity which became personal for you after the birth of your daughter how do you plan to tackle that issue when it comes to the issue around health equity this is actually related to black residents as well so i have been working over time with what s called the black health equity collaborative an organization born out of the framework for racial reconciliation that the city of long beach implemented right after the murder of george floyd the document was designed to make the city accountable toward its black residents it includes milestones metrics and objectives on how to engage with black residents out of that we started exploring how to tie things together to focus on communities of color we already had an office of equity we already had a health department but how do we make sure each community is getting the attention that it needs black residents need it latino residents need it our pacific islander groups need it including our samoans our tongans our chamorro population who are barely even a blip in the data they re never disaggregated out i talked to several of them when i was knocking on doors campaigning and they said they don t even feel visible most of the time at the city level so when we talk about health equity it s about being intentional about those communities that have been marginalized historically and don t even get a voice at the city level and really engaging them with them to uplift their voices and their needs there s a lot of work to do can you also talk about your efforts to expose underrepresented minority urm middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science stephanie reyes tuccio is the assistant vice chancellor for uci s center for educational partnerships cfep which has a group of managers under her that focus on urm students so statistics professor veronica berrocal and i participated in one of their workshops for students in the long beach paramount and compton school districts we did a presentation talking about statistics and what you can do with it and we recruited some students of color from the department of statistics to share their experiences i ve done a couple of presentations with veronica through the cfep talking about the work we do and trying to collaborate with them on projects so ics can be a partner in general but it s interesting because when talking about careers this isn t a pipeline problem it s a recruitment problem we need to better target urm student blocks and expose them to open positions i m a black woman so i have a much more diverse network but you have to be intentional about building a network that is diverse enough to attract the best candidate don t tell me there s no black people or latino people for a position they re out there what are we doing to find them this relates to your icts black thriving initiative strategic plan can you tell us about that after george floyd s murder icts the institute for clinical and translational science started a working group that fall a visioning process about how icts could join with uci s black thriving initiative bti we were trying to assess how we could leverage the resources at icts to double down on our commitment to diversity and make sure we were doing our due diligence to increase the diversity of the clinical translational sciences because historically as much work as it does icts as an entity has not been super diverse again it s just levels of intentionality so we drafted what i think is a comprehensive plan that leverages our strengths and talks about regional partnerships we came up with a series of goals metrics and objectives that map to the three pillars of bti leverage the mission change the culture and engage black communities that was fall of 2020 so how s it going it s been really great we ve been engaging with our education unit to get them to increase the number of nih diversity supplements contacting eligible researchers we ve had a lot of success with that over the last couple of years going from around two supplement applications to six with i think five out of those six being awarded we re also making sure our labs and research groups have culturally competent researchers so when students of color come in they have a sense of belonging and feel comfortable it s all these little interventions you need to do along the way to make things easier and more inclusive we also have a steering committee for the icts that meets every week and we have speakers come in quarterly to talk about different topics related to dei diversity equity and inclusion such as race as a biological versus social construct because race is often controlled and included in analyses and most people don t really know why they include race so we re teaching researchers to critically think about those things or we ve talked about precision of language we had a researcher dr monica mclemore of the university of washington talk about how people use words like equity diversity and inclusion and conflate all these terms without really understanding what they mean we ve also had people talk about workforce development in the clinical space to not only recruit a diverse set of students and faculty but also to think about our clinical trials because we re often testing things on a very specific group demographic we found out the problems of that during the pandemic i don t know if you heard about what happened with the pulse oximeters for measuring your blood oxygen levels but research has shown that the darker your skin the poorer the reading black people with darker skin would go into the emergency room saying i can t breathe but the pulse oximeter reading would say you re at 100 oxygen saturation so the doctors would say you re fine because the finger oximeter couldn t read through darker skin these are things we need to think about during clinical trials when we re testing devices the color of someone s skin matters this ties back into the question of what kind of data you re getting and whether you re getting the full picture from that data on that note and given that it s black history month is there something you d like to share as a source of inspiration there s a book called black like me it s old it s literally like a 50 year old book originally published in 1960 but it s basically the true story of a gentleman a journalist who s white john howard griffin who darkens his skin and then goes to live in the south as a black man it is a fantastic book because you re still the same person but once you remove the privilege of your skin the author experienced what it is like to live through the lens of not having the privilege of whiteness i remember reading that book back when i was maybe in high school and it s a great read and i still remember it to this day anything else you d like to add if there s anyone out there who s interested in the work i m doing on city council or who wants to be a resource or to bend joni s ear on an issue let me know there s going to be times

scientist john peach moderated the discussion which included panelists sarah nooravi christopher talucci and matt weiss who shared their knowledge and experiences on machine learning optimizations mlops and career development with the data science community mlops in the industryone of the first questions peach asked the panelists was what tools and technologies they use to help them build their mlops amazon senior data engineer christopher talucci said he often uses the python programming language and pycharm ide along with aws lambda kafka kinesis and redshift sarah nooravi a revenue strategy lead at snap inc uses airflow python git and bigquery machine learning matt weiss who is a data science manager at meta shared more holistic advice on building good mlops think of the whole process in mind think of the downstream user in mind weiss said think of what this model is going to be doing and how it will utilize its actionability in a business sense in a product sense the first half of the discussion concluded with panelists sharing some mistakes they made in the workplace and the lessons they learned from those mistakes weiss in particular talked about an instance in which he analyzed and interpreted data based on his own assumptions without consulting his colleagues if you are creating anything make sure to check against something that s already been solved said weiss don t make assumptions and find the source of truth if you re trying to re create something you may have some big things you missed career developmentnooravi detailed the challenges she experienced when transitioning to her first career after college at her first job noovari was the youngest and only female employee on her team and several of her colleagues had ph d degrees or had more work experience than her leading her to feel and be isolated and have imposter syndrome i had managers who were very supportive i had friends who were very supportive noovari said explaining that her support system helped her overcome difficulties at work she also highlighted the importance of diversity in the technology industry sharing a time when she was asked to speak on a panel at a conference that typically only invited male speakers the conference later developed an all woman panel peach then asked the panelists several questions about what they wished they had done early on in their career and to give the audience advice on how to succeed in new roles weiss said taking big swings by making high impact decisions is a powerful way to move forward and talucci suggested asking for help when you need it and documenting processes especially when you re new anywhere i do this every time i m new to a job being able to document all the processes that you re going through is always helpful talucci said giving examples such as tracking failures taking screenshots and more to put in your documentation level setting according to noovari is another important skill that helps when working in teams or with stakeholders what i tend to do is err on the side of over communicating noovari said which she explains is a good strategy when being given requests with unrealistic deadlines because stakeholders better understand where she is in the process and can shift their expectations it s when they don t know what s going on is when i think issues come up the last major question of the night was what hard or soft skills will help people level up in their career intellectual curiosity weiss said specifically in my world i look for who can take the question and build the biggest impact and influence with their insights someone who s willing to go the extra mile but be able to really formulate everything from start to finish so they can sell it noovari emphasized developing your communication skills noting that this is not limited to verbal communication like speaking up in meetings i have a lot of introverts on my team and i tell them if it s a zoom call just add things in the chat they can be really good at communication via email written communication can be very strong and offset them not speaking up in meetings noovari said so being an introvert isn t a bad thing it s actually just finding a medium in which you can exercise your skills karen phan student creativity and innovation take center stage at hack at uci 2023faculty spotlight veronica

veronica berrocal tried to convince herself that she did not want to follow in her father s footsteps and study statistics today that young girl from italy is a professor of statistics at uc irvine s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics she has been named a fellow of the american statistical association asa for research in spatial and spatio temporal statistics and applications to atmospheric and environmental sciences and environmental epidemiology she has served as chair of the section in environmental sciences envibayes of the international society of bayesian analysis isba and she has advised the environmental protection agency epa sharing her statistical expertise on scientific advisory panels learn here what finally drew her to the field after years of resistance and how she s now sharing her passion for statistics with others illustrating its impact and importance how did you first become interested in statistics my dad studied statistics but when i was younger i didn t want to do what my dad did when i was in high school and considering what to study at the university i was very undecided my mom suggested that i study math since i really liked it and math has a large number of applications i remember her mentioning atmospheric sciences and weather forecasting so i decided on math stayed clear of anything that had to do with probability or statistics and ended up specializing in differential geometry after getting my b s and m s degrees in math i came to the u s to michigan state university on a scholarship to do research as part of this research i had to learn genetics and how to model genetics data since i did not know statistics i had to take some classes but ones offered not by the department of statistics and probability but by the department of animal science where i was conducting my research i started to take these classes with the goal of developing a model to identify ways to maximize animal production although the statistical topics were interesting i was not really satisfied with the application and the focus on animal production so i decided to take classes from the department of statistics and probability and get a master s in statistics as i did that i got more and more into it and that s how i found myself wanting to go for a ph d so that s how it all started it s funny because i actually ended up following in my dad s footsteps can you talk about how your work blends the fields of statistics and environmental science the environment and environmental science were things i was always interested in even though i didn t grow up in a family of people who typically go hiking camping or anything like that i was interested in animals and i ve always wanted to advocate for the weaker links seeing animals get mistreated trees get cut down or a piece of land get urbanized has always made me sad so i ve always been interested in environmental conservation and when i applied to the ph d program at the university of washington i saw on the webpage of my advisor adrian raftery a project that excited me he wanted to estimate the size of the whale population specifically the bowhead whale the whaling commission needed to establish the quota of whales that could be hunted per year so they needed to have an idea of how many whales there were in the wild that s not easy to determine as one needs to estimate the size of the population based on what one sees occasionally when i went to visit the department though i was told that the funding for the project was over i still ended up going there for my ph d and working with adrian on a project related to atmospheric sciences and weather as my mom predicted years before from there i got interested in developing and applying statistical methods to answer questions in atmospheric sciences e g weather climate air pollution so i ve been interested in this particular area of science for a long time of course now with the threats connected to climate change becoming more and more evident people are very interested in environmental science research in connection to human health and sustainability as well what projects are you working on i ve spent a considerable amount of time working on projects related to air pollution that was something i started to work on during my postdoc and i m still working on it in fact i m collaborating with jun wu here at uci on a couple of projects that are focused on estimating air pollution levels in california and quantifying the effect of wildfires particularly on pregnant women i have also recently been invited to be part of an advisory panel that will be reviewing a tool the epa has developed called ejscreen the tool lets you map and compare exposure to various environmental risk factors across space air pollution is of course one of the environmental risk factors that poses a threat to human health more recently i ve become interested in climate change not only for its effects on human health or natural habitats but also in terms of agricultural production at this point despite the climate disinformation campaign i hope everybody understands that the climate is changing and that global warming is real for me even though i know that addressing climate change requires making country level political decisions across the globe especially by the countries that are the biggest polluters i realized that i want to contribute to research on climate change more on the front of mitigation what can we do to mitigate the effects of climate change you re also helping expose underrepresented minority middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science can you talk a bit about those efforts i ve been thinking about the issue of diversity in statistics for a long time in part because i am mixed race and i never completely felt at ease in certain environments so i always think about how it feels to be a student in a field where you don t see many other people like you or you don t recognize your experience in the experience of your peers the only way things can change is if we increase the number of students and faculty from diverse backgrounds there is a lot of effort in trying to recruit students into the graduate program but i think we need to start a little bit earlier for some disciplines it s easy for students to think i want to become a doctor or i want to be an engineer because people are familiar with these careers but if you re not around people who are familiar with the department of statistics or the school of ics you might not really know about data science as i was thinking about how we might reach middle or high school students i talked to joni ricks oddie director of uci s center for statistical consulting joni had a connection with uci s center for educational partnerships cfep and she introduced me to the group we did our first panel discussion together with high school students from orange county after that first event i did other presentations with cfep i really enjoy talking to these kids and hope they will consider going to college for data science and maybe even grad school but even just getting them into data science as an undergraduate is a win there needs to be more outreach to put statistics and data science on the map for people as i gave these presentations i realized that many high school students don t know what data science is or what type of jobs one could do with a degree in data science many high school students also don t know what a professor does besides teaching you also did a seminar series on data science careers correct two years ago i got an ics inspiration award and i organized a seminar series on career paths that was meant to help graduate students because of the pandemic the seminars were all hosted on zoom despite not being in person i managed to invite people from different sectors so that they could give graduate students an idea of the types of careers they could pursue after completing either their master s or ph d degree with the seminars i also wanted to help take away the anxiety that students often have of thinking i have to figure out my life completely once i get my degree or i m stuck in a certain career for the rest of my life i wanted students to know that there are many different paths that one can construct our first speaker violeta hennessey works at paramount pictures she got her ph d in biostatistics at md anderson and is now the director of paramount s digital archives and analytics another speaker luke bornn used to be the vice president of strategy and analytics for an nba team and now is co founder of a sports analytics company but he started as a professor we also had speakers in more traditional careers a data scientist who works at google a director of biostatistics within a pharmaceutical company a professor focused mostly on statistical education and a researcher who works in a government lab all the speakers talked about how they built their career and what types of problems or projects they typically work on students really liked it anyone interested in viewing the seminars can contact me how has public awareness around statistics changed since you first entered the field i can definitely say that even though i have only been a faculty member for 13 or 14 years i can see the impact of statistics on public discourse i remember when i was still an assistant professor at the university of michigan and i got invited as an ad hoc member to join advisory panels i would often be the only statistician on the panel the rest of the panel was composed of toxicologists and environmental health scientists now i get emails where the epa explicitly states that they are looking for people with biostatistics or statistics expertise to serve on this or that advisory panel and i think that s true for many other advisory panels more and more the importance of statistics is being recognized and statisticians are getting more involved in the public discourse i think this really speaks to the impact of statistics it s women s history month any women in stem trailblazers you want to spotlight keeping it close to the areas of statistics that i work in there are two women that i would like to highlight francesca dominici from harvard university was among the first statisticians to work on studies that assess the impact of air pollution on health using very large population level studies she has contributed to evidence on the adverse health effects of air pollution and her work continues to have enormous impact i really look up to her also anybody who works in bayesian statistics and spatial and environmental epidemiology knows sylvia richardson her work on bayesian computation mcmc and on spatial modeling are part of fundamental knowledge for anybody who works in spatial epidemiology from a bayesian perspective our own department of statistics also has two trailblazers jessica utts and annie qu jessica s impact on statistical education is long lasting thousands of students have learned statistics in their undergraduate classes using one of jessica s books and annie s research breadth and contribution to statistics are quite hard to match i don t think there are many statisticians who have never encountered her name on a statistical paper seen her name on the program of a statistical conference or seen her give a presentation so we don t have to go far to find inspiring women shani murray mds

emily truong moves to the rhythm of algorithms march 16 2023 as a dancer fourth year honors student emily truong has seen countless injuries around her she wanted to study dance and biology on a pre medicine track and become a doctor however after exploring the field of data science truong learned about the large scale impact she can make on the healthcare industry through data and was inspired to double major in dance and data science during my first year i took all these math classes and i was looking into which pathways use a lot of math says truong she also shadowed data scientists at a financial technology firm and self taught herself python the summer before college i thought data science could be an interesting pathway to go through so i started taking some data science classes and realized that i really liked it truong shared that her experience of touring uci was memorable and unique compared to other schools she toured which is one of the reasons she decided to attend uci one thing i remembered about uci was my campus tour guide said that uci was the first school to reverse boil an egg she says i thought uci was really pretty and calm truong is also minoring in bioinformatics and says research is a big part of her time at uci research is how she blends her passion for medicine with data since her second year truong has worked with health researchers as a research assistant in informatics professor kai zheng s lab she is also a student manager and supervises fellow student researchers in the lab she is especially proud of a yearlong study she worked on that examined pre and post covid 19 opioid overdoses which will be published and presented in april at the uc real world evidence conference currently truong is working with uci health s all of us database to gather information on patient recruitment in clinical trials join clubs and organizations a lot of research positions are passed down that way networking is also really important she says adding that contacting professors directly and reading emails from the ics student affairs office are other ways to find openings in research labs outside of her data science classes and research at uci truong is part of the engineering fraternity theta tau where she created a gesture controlled automated curtain with her fraternity brothers this past summer she interned at kaiser permanente and worked with data on hypertension heart attack and stroke outcomes and suicide prevention truong has spent the second half of her college career focused on research and learning more about data science to prepare herself for a career in data science her double major in dance and data science helps her balance the stress and demands of her math and computer science classes because she enjoys the creativity stimulation and exercise in her dance classes after i come out of computer science class i m like oh i m so tired but after i go to dance class it boosts my energy says truong it s a really nice balance when she graduates truong hopes to continue dancing recreationally many of the soft skills she applies to her research and internship experience in data science come from dancing which she has been doing since she was 5 years old she says her work ethic time management and planning skills and creativity all come from dancing one of emily s hobbies is crocheting her latest creation is this frog with a busy school schedule truong turns to a few activities and hobbies to de stress she is part of a dance team on campus called project renegade and the sorority tri delta and enjoys attending dance performances on campus to support her peers she also likes to spend time with her friends and crochet her most recent creation is a frog truong is interested in careers in data science that will allow her to influence people and improve lives at scale her internship at kaiser permanente has also inspired her to pursue a graduate degree in data science and a role in predictive analysis one of the things that brought me into data science was realizing that i could do a lot of work behind the scenes and actually impact a lot of people at once she says karen phan faculty

inaugural datathon would not have been possible without the dedication and marketing efforts of their board members and interns since this is our first datathon we had to essentially start from scratch says yee one of the biggest challenges was securing data challenges and funding for our event we ve sent hundreds of emails and linkedin messages to different companies and organizations with a dozen at most responding back we were very glad of the sponsors and funding we were able to receive according to data uci president and third year data science major william hou the club s hard work paid off the datathon exceeded hou s expectations before it officially began our team has never put on an event like this before so there was a lot of uncertainty especially when we first started planning around whether people would actually sign up says hou we ended up not only meeting our attendance goal but actually having to waitlist some of our applicants due to capacity limitations hou also expresses excitement about successfully putting a data related spin on traditional software hackathons adding that data uci plans to host a bigger and better datathon next year data uci hopes to build a strong reputation for its collegiate datathon in the years to come in the meantime hou and yee encourage students to continue participating in datathons you have the opportunity to work in a

establish a data science major uc irvine has been an educational leader in this growing field for close to a decade in addition to launching the major in 2015 uci recently started hosting summer programs for both high school and undergraduate students interested in data analytics and biostatistics and its socal data science program helps recruit train and dispatch a diverse workforce of stem and data science majors now the socal data science program is scaling up thanks to a 1 3 million pathways development grant from the california education learning lab the socal data science programthe socal data science program kicked off in 2022 with a three year 1 5 million grant from the national science foundation the program is a collaborative effort between faculty from uci california state university fullerton csuf and cypress college and the inaugural cohort of 32 fellows drawn from all three campuses attended a one week training bootcamp and conducted a six week research project at uci last summer professor babak shahbaba with the program welcoming 30 new fellows later this month statistics professor babak shahbaba of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics is already looking to the future as we are working with this new cohort finishing the second year we re thinking about continuity and sustainability says shahbaba the program lead at uci we don t want the program and the benefit that it provides to end when the nsf grant ends the new four year pathways development grant guarantees that the benefits will continue creating a pipeline of talentthe grant proposal titled pipe line programs for institutional pathway engagement accelerating infrastructure and education outlines ways to develop pathways and overcome equity gaps in data science learning csuf will serve as the host organization with professor jessica jaynes as project lead partnering closely with faculty from uci riverside city college rcc and rio hondo college rhc this grant will help us continue and expand our activities around data science education at the undergraduate level says shahbaba and this actually goes beyond the students it includes developing training materials and hosting workshops for instructors to build the required infrastructure the socal data science program aligns perfectly with the california learning lab s grand challenge on building critical mass for data science the learning lab wanted to establish this relationship between different tiers of academic institutes in california and we were already doing that with a uc cal state and community college says shahbaba the pipe line proposal has three overarching goals create pathways in data science between the three institutional tiers by establishing new courses and programs address equity gaps in data science education by expanding access to technology resources incorporating culturally relevant pedagogy and applying a content with context approach and support a diverse group of faculty and students in data science resulting in a robust community of data science learners the proposal doesn t extend the number of fellows 120 expected to be funded with the nsf grant rather it helps ensure other students have access to the same type of data science education outside of the program it s more about building the infrastructure to replicate the training that we ve been providing to these fellows and to scale it up says shahbaba as part of this work ics will host training workshops and an annual data science education conference helping instructors establish data science courses at community colleges and building a strong sense of community and at cal state fullerton adds shahbaba we will look into setting up a data science major and minor this creates a pipeline of talent for not only industry but for graduate programs as well we provide this program to help the students but also it helps uci in a way explains shahbaba two of the fellows from cal state fullerton in last year s cohort were among the 11 students accepted into uci s statistics ph d program this year so it s a two way gateway we transfer the knowledge and experience that we have developed over many years and in return we re recruiting these highly diverse skilled and motivated students pipe line thus aims to arm the next generation of data scientists with the knowledge and tools needed to tackle tomorrow s biggest challenges students well trained in data science at the undergraduate level strengthen data analytics in all industries from healthcare to transportation and support graduate level statistical research that will advance our understanding of issues ranging from disease prevention to climate change leading to novel solutions shani murray ics and engineering

least of the 11 ceremonies said dean marios c papaefthymiou in his welcoming remarks to the crowd of students families and friends and esteemed faculty students at the 2023 ics commencement ceremony this celebration of the roughly 815 undergraduate degrees 160 graduate degrees and 275 professional masters degrees that ics expects to confer this year began with an inspiring rendition of the national anthem performed by aerodynamix an a capella group of uci students the class of 2023 heard from classmate nadia etemadi who spoke of her journey to becoming a software developer and from featured speaker julia white chief marketing and solutions officer at the enterprise software company sap who offered words of wisdom from her nearly 30 years in the tech industry first however provost and executive vice chancellor hal stern congratulated the students the students that we re celebrating especially many of the undergraduates had a remarkable educational experience he noted impacted by a global pandemic that changed the world in ways that nobody could have imagined he commended the students for their ability to maintain their focus on projects problem sets labs and reports and for their personal growth you ve been challenged in classes and in your conversations with your friends to accept understand and challenge different points of view said stern highlighting a core element of the college experience society needs more people with the ability to listen to give people the benefit of the doubt and to engage in civil conversation with those with whom we disagree emphasizing that commencement marks a new beginning stern challenged the students to do all the little things you can to make the world a better place and to find your passion and pursue it building on communities of supportdean marios then introduced etemadi an iranian american graduating with her master s degree in software engineering as etemadi took the stage she transported the audience back in time imagine for a moment that it s the year 2013 she started i was a nervous wreck of a 14 year old sitting in my counselor s office in selecting the last elective for her first year of high school she had to choose between woodshop or intro to computer programming she remembered calling her mom for advice ever the cautious parent she suggested computer programming i can t exactly chop my arm off with a keyboard and mouse said etemadi laughing that one decision ended up cultivating a love of programming within me she said dragging and dropping code blocks in scratch might have just been another elective course for some kids but for me it was a window into a whole new world after high school etemadi s dreams of attending an elite college came crashing down when she was rejected everywhere she applied so she found another path she attended west valley community college where she found a community of incredibly talented compassionate professors and students she went on to study computer science at uc davis where she again found a community of supportive classmates the culmination of which was a zoom graduation in her living room as a graduate student at uci her initial online connections flourished with the return to on campus learning and she collaborated with fellow graduate students and research lab members with help from her advisor andre van der hoek she developed a prototype tool that lets people edit videos to attach to bug reports now as she prepares to find a job as a software developer she looks forward to meeting yet another community of talented and supportive peers and colleagues she wishes the same for her fellow graduates advising the class of 2023 to carve out a space for themselves that builds on their unique experiences memories and communities from uci student speaker nadia etemadi and her advisor informatics professor andre van der hoek finding the constant in an ever changing worldwhite who earned her b a from stanford university and mba from harvard and who spent 20 years at microsoft before joining sap acknowledged that commencement speakers often talk of unprecedented times yet for this class of 2023 she stressed that these times are truly unprecedented she talked not only of the start of their college journey and the resilience required during the global pandemic but also of the end of their journey as they enter the workforce at the dawn of the next massive revolution in technology with artificial intelligence she assured the students that armed with a world class education they are well prepared for the challenges and opportunities that await them the bren school has prepared you with the latest technology skills the ability to think critically and hands on experiences at some of the most innovative organizations in the world she also spoke to the first generation college students who made up nearly half of the graduating class you re creating a new legacy for your family and community which is remarkable she went on to share what she has learned from her nearly 30 years of working in technology which started with launching online banking at intuit technology is always advancing but there s no technology advancement without people she compared today s angst about ai s impact on jobs to what she saw back in 2007 with the cloud revolution as she helped move companies away from their server rooms to cloud based services she recognized the importance of retraining it professionals providing opportunities for career advancement as well as for further cloud innovation humanity needs to be at the center of everything we do in technology stressed white we re so lucky to have the skills the know how to help the world run better through technology it s an awesome opportunity and a massive responsibility calling on the class of 2023 to act as values based tech minded leaders she acknowledged that it s a tumultuous time do not lose hope because today every company is a tech company retailers manufactures banks automotive companies nonprofit governments all of them are in dire need of your skills every company now competes and differentiates with technology she also acknowledged the power of ai but insisted it s still just a tool one that you will be at the forefront of guiding and harnessing she then implored the next generation of tech leaders to use their knowledge and skills to improve society prioritizing responsible and ethical development tech will always advance let your values and ethics be the constant in an ever changing world featured commencement speaker julia white of sap the strongest anteater zot to conclude the ceremony dean marios asked all of the family and friends to stand as he recognized their support in

outside the box when it comes to providing the technical expertise and skillsets students need for success says ics director of corporate relations jason king and we could not do this without our industry partners who offer unique opportunities for professional development and mentorship the capstone experiencethe projects on display were completed for undergraduate capstone courses in informatics computer science and game design for the ics honors program and for the butterworth product development competition these programs benefit not only students who gain opportunities for practical application and important soft skills but also benefit program sponsors who gain opportunities for recruitment and support for under resourced projects once again there was a wide range in the diversity of projects covering domains ranging from web development and social media to ai and machine learning to all the hot topics of the day says informatics professor hadar ziv who taught the first informatics capstone course in ics back in 2009 in fact two of the three winning projects for informatics were in the medical field with a direct impact on society these projects were beatingmelanoma com sponsored by hoag and memory air which enhances memory recall through the sense of smell there were also novel games on display in game design we talk a lot about polish making those small adjustments that take a game from good to great capstone is the class where they get to see a project all the way through says informatics professor kurt squire who led the capstone projects for the game design and interactive media major the students work closely with industry mentors who can point them to resources and processes that go beyond what any one faculty can do alone computer science professor sergio gago masague who leads the capstone course for the department of computer science also highlights the benefits for students the program gives students the opportunity to apply their computer science skills and knowledge to real world problems and to closely work with industry partners to develop innovative solutions he says it is a great opportunity to learn and grow and the ics project expo really is the culmination of these efforts bringing all the program parties together and rewarding everyone s good work especially the students with more than 300 attendees including students and faculty project and corporate partners and alumni the event excelled in uniting a variety of industry and academic stakeholders award winning projectsnew to the ics project expo this year was the chance for each team to win up to 2 300 for the top awards a group of industry leaders ics alumni and faculty used the rocketjudge app to score all of the projects with

management navigate team dynamics manage delivery deadlines develop solutions for real life business problems and most of all practice and hone presentation skills i am very excited to see the capstone program grow and evolve and hope a variety of companies leverage project sponsorship as a tool for recruitment and engagement developing a tech talent pipelineanother expo attendee mark percy president of the ceo leadership alliance of orange county claoc also hopes to encourage more corporate sponsorships with ceo members representing a good cross section of large medium and small employers in the region claoc is working to grow oc into a tech talent hub i was incredibly impressed and found the program introductions valuable to understand the breadth and depth of talent within ics says percy the students were super sharp and the ones i spoke to were very articulate explaining their projects this piqued his interest in potential collaborations i hope to encourage more of our members to undertake future projects and mentor the ics students he says he similarly hopes to encourage ics students to look for job opportunities in orange county all of our claoc members want to invest in local talent and most are developing a tech talent pipeline right here the ics project expo highlights how uci is instrumental in supporting that pipeline and keeping local companies on the cutting edge of technological advances the ics capstone program is only growing says ziv the future trajectory is exciting if you are a company interested in sponsoring a capstone project contact mimi

instructors from all around the country arrived at uc irvine for a weeklong boot camp aimed at advancing bayesian thinking in stem bats nancy elizabeth wentzel of tennessee an assistant math professor at northeast state community college was among the bats attendees i ve told my students before that the computational power we have now has revolutionized the way we re able to approach statistical problems says wentzel who teaches an introductory course in statistics however prior to attending the bats boot camp she had only a vague understanding of bayesian statistics and the real world problems it can address having almost no experience working with realistically large data sets statistical modeling programming bayesian inference or analysis of results i ve now seen examples of all of these and been able to follow along with the big picture of what bayesian methods look like in different contexts says wentzel this will enable me to speak with more knowledge and conviction about the importance of bayesian methods to accomplish incredibly meaningful real world progress on the problems that matter most to all of us in healthcare technology and every other area of modern life bats program directors and boot camp attendees the need for new trainingthe wide range of applications for bayesian statistics from supply chain management to climate change adaptation was part of the motivation for creating the bats program there is such a need for this kind of training says statistics professor mine dogucu of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics dogucu is leading the bats program in collaboration with jingchen monika hu of vassar college and amy herring of duke university the program stems from a paper dogucu and hu wrote last year the current state of undergraduate bayesian education and recommendations for the future as outlined in the paper their review of 150 colleges across the u s revealed that only 46 offered a bayesian course and in all but four it was an elective not required course uci was one of only four that required the course for its data science major says dogucu based on the findings and with funding from a national science foundation nsf program aimed at improving undergraduate stem education dogucu hu and herring designed a program to broaden the reach of bayesian learning through instructor training we have a lot of programs designed for students says dogucu but there s very very few opportunities for faculty training after people get their ph d advancing bayesian thinking in stembats is a three tiered program for training stem instructors and for developing and disseminating learning materials that highlight the use of bayesian methods in stem fields program participants receive a stipend helping cover their time and expenses tier one of the program is the summer boot camp offered at uci this summer and on the east coast at vassar college in summer 2024 uci s boot camp attendees came from both two and four year institutions and from a variety of departments including math economics biology and public policy the weeklong program included daily lessons on bayesian inference computing and modeling put together by dogucu hu and herring ics ph d student federica zoe ricci also supported the program as a graduate student researcher tier two of the program will take place this fall with 10 instructors selected from the boot camp to develop bayesian teaching and learning materials using scientific data from their fields dogucu hu and herring will mentor the instructors and help guide curriculum development tier three will then involve having five of those 10 instructors showcase the materials at conferences and through open access publications in tier one they learn about basic statistics and in tier two we want to see how this can directly impact student outcomes with new teaching materials explains dogucu then in tier three we want this impact to reach a national audience with published papers and presentations at conferences the ultimate goal is to strengthen undergraduate level statistics education for improved scientific outcomes most importantly there are two big paradigms to approaching statistics frequentist which comes with p values and bayesian says dogucu moving forward it would be very good if instructors knew both of these methods well

august 10 2023 did people enjoy the movie spider man no way home how did fans react to delays in releasing the sequel to hollow knight how did red states versus blue states view the 2020 election did the release of valorant increase its popularity and what about the popularity of high school football these are the questions 10 high school students in teams of two chose to explore during a new data science for all summer program held at uc irvine from july 10 21 2023 the students analyzed related tweets using texera an open source platform for collaborative data analytics the platform is being developed by professor chen li of the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics who led the summer program in collaboration with professor wei wang of ucla thanks to funding through the national science foundation s broadening participation in computing bpc program the two week summer camp which ran from 9 a m 4 p m on weekdays and included lunch was free to attend instructors included both uci and ucla professors and ph d students with expertise in data management data science and machine learning the goal was to leverage the texera platform in teaching students particularly those with a limited background in computing data science and machine learning techniques including basic concepts about data wrangling ml training data classification sentiment analysis and visualization one of the high school students lesley gomez says that participating in the program has inspired her to delve deeper into data science the interactive lectures and completing labs through the texera platform helped me gain a deeper understanding of data science additionally this program gave me the opportunity to enhance several essential skills including public speaking as we got to deliver presentations to high school students the creators of texera and parents she says overall the ds4all program was a great experience for me high school students in uci ics shirts with their instructors for the data science 4 all program teaching with texerathe first week li and xiaozhen liu a computer science ph d student at uci taught the students about big data preparation discussing topics such data modeling databases data cleaning data wrangling and visualization the second week ucla instructors gave lectures on machine learning ai and natural language processing throughout the program students attended lab sessions and gained hands on experience using texera for the capstone project students selected their own topic for sentiment analysis we gave them the raw tweets and they spent the first week cleaning the data says liu then they did the analysis during the second week using machine learning models on these tweets to gain some insights high school students zeina harden and vitoria mendez building a texera workflow together to analyze tweets about high school football left and discussing their workflow during their final presentation right it s amazing that these students despite their various backgrounds within one day were able to become familiar with texera and then use the system to do data wrangling and data preparation steps says li we were pretty happy to see the students learn how to use the system so quickly aside from its user friendly gui another benefit of texera is that you don t have to install any compute intensive software everything happens on the server side so you can even use an old laptop that is cheap and not very powerful says li during the program uci provided students with mac laptops and they didn t need to always have the same laptop they just needed to go to the website and log in that s the beauty of the cloud service chris rodas and lesley gomez give their presentation on their analysis of spider man no way home tweets talking about how they used logistic regression training what s nextthe program was a win win for students and faculty alike a benefit to us is the students were using our servers so they gave us a lot of good feedback about texera s usability scalability and efficiency says li which is also beneficial to our research the nsf funding for the project is for two years so li plans to host the program again next summer hopefully doubling the number of attendees to 20 he is also exploring other ways to leverage texera to introduce students to data science we need to think about how to repeat this program in a more systematic way he says summer is good because most students have free time but how else might we broaden participation the team is considering other ways to leverage texera in introducing data science to high school students or to undergraduate students who aren t majoring in a stem field we plan to organize all our materials for not only the same program next year but also possibly for some other programs says li our platform is especially useful for people who have a limited it background that s the sweet spot for us because of texera s cloud model and user friendly interface so we re pretty happy with how the program turned out shani murray summer school for stem faculty a boot camp in bayesian thinkingmandt appointed program chair for aistats

the flamingo project on data cleaning the flamingo project on data cleaning department of computer science uc irvine objective the flamingo project focuses on data cleaning i e how to deal with errors and inconsistencies in information systems as an example in many applications such as data integration commercial organizations need to collect data from various sources to conduct analysis and make decisions often the data from these different sources can have inconsistencies for instance we use first name last name ssn and birthday to identify a person however the same name e g schwarzenegger may be misspelled as swarzzengaer or other forms such errors make it more challenging to link records from different places and answer queries approximately we are developing algorithms in order to make query answering and information retrieval efficient in the presence of such inconsistencies and errors with the nsf award iis 0844574 we plan to study the following problems supporting fuzzy queries is becoming increasingly more important in applications that need to deal with a variety of data inconsistencies in structures representations or semantics many existing algorithms require an offline analysis of data sets to construct an efficient index structure to support online query processing fuzzy join queries of data sets are more time consuming due to the computational complexity the pi is studying three research problems 1 constructing high quality inverted lists for fuzzy search queries using hadoop 2 supporting fuzzy joins of large data sets using hadoop and 3 using the developed techniques to improve data quality of large collections of documents with the nsf award 1030002 we will study how to support powerful keyword search with efficient indexing structures and algorithms in a clouding computing infrastructure a main application is supporting family reunification in disasters such as the haiti earthquake check our portals for the haiti earthquake and chile earthquake the main challenge is how to use limited programming primitives in the cloud to implement index structures and search algorithms our qspeller project page for the microsoft speller

alsubaiee ph d student alexander behm ph d student shengyue ji ph d student liang jin graduated from uc irvine in 2005 chen li faculty jiaheng lu postdoc 2006 2008 now a faculty at renmin university china yiming lu graduated from uc irvine in 2008 rares vernica ph d student back to flamingo main page getting started please refer to the flamingo getting started guide introduction this release in c includes the source code of several algorithms for approximate string matching developed at uc irvine it includes algorithms for approximate selection queries location based approximate keyword search selectivity estimation for approximate selection queries approximate queries on mixed types and others although an implementation for approximate joins is included the focus of this release is on approximate selection queries here is a brief explanation of the terms used above approximate string search given a collection of strings and a single string how to find those strings in the collection that are similar to the given string this functionality is implemented by the modules common filtertree listmerger stringmap and partenum we recommend getting started with the filtertree module for this purpose selectivity estimation for approximate string search given a collection of strings and a single string how can we estimate the number of strings that are similar to the given string this functionality is implemented in the sepia module approximate string join given two collections of strings possibly the same collection how to find those pairs of strings that are similar to each other location based approximate keyword search given a collection of spatial objects with descriptive keywords find those objects within a given spatial region that have a given set of keywords in addition the keywords don t need to match exactly but approximately this functionality is implemented by the module lbak tree there are various string similarity functions such as levenshtein distance aka the edit distance jaccard similarity cosine similarity and dice similarity the following is a description of the modules corresponding to the source directory structure common this module contains classes for supporting the following similarity functions distance measures levenshtein distance aka edit distance jaccard similarity cosine similarity dice similarity it also provides functionality for decomposing strings into grams filtertree this module provides functionality for approximate string search using an inverted list index furthermore query performance can be improved by adding filters i e partitioning the string collection into disjoint subsets according to some property e g the length of the strings the use of filters is facilitated by a hierarchical structure the filtertree in which each level in the tree corresponds to one filter we have implemented the length and charsum filter this package contains three flavors of indexes in memory indexes compressed uncompressed and a disk based index listmerger answering approximate string queries based on an inverted list index requires finding elements that occur at least t times on the inverted lists belonging to the grams in the query string t depends on the similarity metric and the similarity threshold this problem is commonly referred to as the t occurrence problem this module implements several algorithms for solving the t occurrence problem as described in efficient merging and filtering algorithms for approximate string searches chen li jiaheng lu and yiming lu icde 2008 in addition we have implemented efficient algorithms for disk based indexes mat tree mat tree is an indexing structure to support queries on data with an approximate string predicate and a numeric predicate a typical query is find employee records whose name is similar to speilberg and whose age is close to 45 the indexing structure is proposed in the following paper indexing mixed types for approximate retrieval liang jin nick koudas chen li anthony k h tung vldb 2005 trondheim norway sepia this technique solves the problem of estimating the selectivity of an approximate string predicate it can answer questions such as from a collection of strings how many of them have an edit distance within 3 to a given string such information can be used in optimizing queries of approximate string matching the technique was published in the paper selectivity estimation for fuzzy string predicates in large data sets liang jin and chen li vldb 2005 trondheim norway stringmap this algorithm maps strings from the edit distance metric space to a high dimensional euclidean space and uses a multi dimensional indexing structure to answer approximate queries the algorithm is published in the paper efficient record linkage in large data sets by liang jin chen li and sharad mehrotra in 8th international conference on database systems for advanced applications dasfaa 2003 kyoto japan partenum this algorithm is published in the paper efficient exact set similarity joins arvind arasu venkatesh ganti raghav kaushik vldb 2006 we implemented the algorithm to support approximate string matching queries excluding approximate joins topk this package contains algorithms for efficient top k approximate string search lbak tree this module implements location based approximate keyword search as described in supporting location based approximate keyword search by sattam alsubaiee alexander behm and chen li it enhances an r tree with inverted indexes for approximate selection queries it implements various algorithms for choosing r tree nodes to place inverted indexes in the filtertree module is used to provide the inverted indexes for approximate selection queries in addition we have provided some commonly used functions in the util directory changes in version 4 1 compared to version 4 0 added support for damerau levenshtein distance edit distance also allowing swapping of two adjacent characters compilation warning fixes for osx submitted by jim apple from on time systems thanks a lot jim fixed 64 bit issues in lbak tree bibtex misc misc flamingo4 1 2010 author alexander

inclusion of types in dbmss postgres paper introduction slides march 31st april 5th data models query languages temporal data the concept of time is critical in almost all database applications after all databases store the entities in the physical world which is constantly evolving yet basic sql does not include any specific ways of querying over time ideally we would like to be able to be able to query to be run on any snapshot of time not just the current time e g we should be able to ask a query what was the average age of employees at uci last year and not just what is the average age of the employees at uci which is essentially interpreted as a query on the database state right now after all the database has associated with it a concept of a log which stores the whole history of the evolution of the data so logically we should be able to query the database for any instance of time these set of papers will highlight some of the finest progress and ideas in thinking reasoning and support the notion of time in databases we will explore query languages data models representation and also look at some of the implication of representing time in databases the papers we will read

14th representing managing streaming data streaming data management systems change the traditional paradigm of data management wherein data is mostly static and queries dynamically arrive in streaming data systems the queries are expected to be static also known as continuous queries and data arrives dynamically streaming data is not a new concept e g pub sub systems and event processing systems of the past and present have similar characteristics many of the technologies query languages processing mechanisms etc can and have been borrowed in building stream management systems stream data management systems extend the above work in variety of ways more complex query languages which are more expressive compared to say languages supported by pub sub systems new processing optimization techniques new approaches to load management e g load shedding as a mechanism to achieve cost versus quality tradeoff approximation as a mechanism to achieve scalability etc most work on stream data management has been driven from applications such as network monitoring complex analysis on event oriented information and continuous monitoring in adhoc sensor networks in the context of sensor data additional design constraints of sensor battery preservation has also been extensively studied techniques such as cost quality tradeoffs and in network processing of queries have been explored our goal in this class is to explore the area of stream data management from the perspective of data model and query languages specifically what types of queries are important over streaming data and how

cypress home people publications events videos and demos for members cypress dependability techniques for instrumented cyber physical spaces the cypress cyber physical resilliance and sustainability project explores techniques for dependability resilience and sustainability in cyberphysical spaces the project derives its name from the cypress tree that represents durability and sustainability advances in sensing embedded computing and communication technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to add intelligence into physical systems and enable the creation of instrumented cyber physical spaces icpss example critical infrastructures include airports energy distribution networks and organizations such as schools and hospitals example critical applications range from surveillance to security and situation aware emergency response for icpss to transform our lives through new functionality robustness and efficiency they must provide dependable infrastructure components in the presence of failures and disruptions and generate dependable information in the face of errors in sensing communications and computations dynamic adaptability of large icpss that employ heterogeneous sensing and actuation technologies becomes the fundamental enabler for dependable icpss dependability as defined by the ifip 10 4 working group on dependable computing and fault tolerance refers to the trustworthiness of computing systems that allows reliance to be justifiably placed on the services it delivers dependability constitutes a variety of non functional requirements including availability reliability maintainability safety and integrity in the context of icps dependability can broadly be classified at two interdependent levels that combined can provide a trustworthy platform for building applications infrastructure dependability how dependable are the underlying infrastructure components e g sensors networks actuators computing storage elements software environments in the presence of diverse failures that may lead to disruptions and information dependability how dependable is the information generated by the underlying infrastructure given errors uncertainty in sensor readings and data analysis mechanisms in this project we are expoiting an observe analyze adapt oaa architecture in which an icps has a model of itself its objectives and its effects on the environment the icps achieves dependability objectives through adaptation using runtime application of formal analysis methods the proposed dependability techniques are cross layer in nature and range from combining multiple networking and messaging technologies to adaptive sensing and information fusion figure 1 illustrates our approach to designing icps management software using oaa approach where a self observing introspecting system will initiate a logical adaptation of its components to meet dependability needs icps systems and devices designed using a cross layer architecture supply dynamic streams of information that are used by application which in turn adapt the usage and execution of the infrastructure since icps systems are dynamic observation and monitoring of a system and its evolution is critical to enabling dependability at the heart of the system is the icps statedb that implements the observe aspect of the oaa cycle a formal modeling and reasoning component allows for concrete specification of the icps system and analyzes the current system state to reason about the dependability properties providing a limited but focused analyze component in the oaa cycle the outcome of the analysis will help us generate adaptations that comply with dependability constraints the adaptation component makes changes to deal with dynamics in the environment implements human driven changes by embedding human activities and human in the loop decisions and deploys the logical adaptations into the physical icps infrastructure a key feature of our approach see right side of figure 2 is the ability to perform cross layer analysis and adaptation both vertically i e across abstraction layers ranging from the application to middleware os and hardware and horizontally across geographically distributed components interconnected via multiple heterogeneous networks thus oaa at the infrastructure level enables stability of the entire operational infrastructure the proposed effort focuses on system level techniques for dependable cps operation human interactions occur via applications that specify their dependability needs there are four main research tasks included in our project 1 dependable cross layer observation and state management 2 formal methods for cps system dependability analysis 3 adaptations to support infrastructure dependability 4 adaptations to support information dependability research task 1 corresponds to the observe step in oaa in this task we will generate a cross layer specification of the underlying system its abilities and application dependability needs using quantitative and qualitative analysis and design an icps state capture service for the analyze step we use lightweight formal methods to analyze the current state of the system given an infrastructure and application to determine violations of dependability needs task 2 finally the adapt step is investigated in research tasks 3 and 4 where adaptations are designed to enhance infrastructure and information dependability we aim to develop 1 an array of specific cross layer adaptation techniques to support infrastructure and information dependability in icpss using the oaa paradigm 2 a formal modeling framework supporting executable formal models to maintain runtime system models and formal analysis techniques to guide the adaptation process and 3 the incorporation of 1 and 2 into middleware services that provide dependability aware icps state management and adaptation responsphere i sensorium

recent news news virtual disaster cities to provide real life resilience virtual disaster cities to provide real life resilience september 16 2024 share this share on facebookshare on twittershare on linkedinshare through emailcopy permalink after a massive earthquake struck japan on march 11 2011 teachers at ukedo elementary school ordered a swift evacuation to higher ground saving the entire student body from the deadly tsunami that followed tragically students at okawa elementary school remained in the schoolyard instead of moving to a nearby hillside resulting in the loss of 74 students and 10 teachers given the enormous impact of such split second decisions how can we better prepare people to make informed choices when facing an impending disaster computer science professor nalini venkatasubramanian is exploring this question through a partnership between uc irvine and tohoku university in japan after going through the 2011 earthquake and tsunami researchers at tohoku started conducting tsunami inundation modeling so they have a huge amount of expertise in this type of planning says venkatasubramanian she and a team of researchers in uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics have their own expertise in leveraging data gathered through the internet of things iot to help protect vulnerable communities particularly older adults now the two groups of researchers are collaborating on a three year 1m grant funded through the national science foundation nsf and japan science and technology jst agency the joint nsf jst project enabling human centered digital twins for community resilience aims to apply the concept of digital twins to disaster science better analyzing the impact of natural disasters on humans and outlining real time pathways to safety protecting older adults the situation becomes even more dire when it comes to populations with specialized needs like older adults or people with disabilities says venkatasubramanian so we re focusing on leveraging data from these digital twins to reduce the vulnerabilities of older adults during a natural disaster the u s team includes computer science professor sharad mehrotra and other ics faculty remote sensing and geographic information system gis experts from boston university and experts from imagecat inc a risk management innovation company in long beach the researchers are also engaging with julie rousseau and lisa gibbs geriatric medical experts from the uci school of medicine and nursing with medical multi complexity older adults face higher morbidity and mortality during disasters around the world says rousseau with rapidly rising 65 populations japan and the u s need innovative solutions to build equitable disaster resilience for vulnerable older adults with physical and or cognitive disabilities the project involves designing tools to create disaster digital twin ddt cities that are representative of sendai in japan and southern california in the u s these cyberworld replicas will highlight both what these communities have in common as well as certain differences while southern california has a lot of continuing care facilities housing larger groups of older adults together the community structure is very different in japan where older adults are oftentimes more integrated into the general community living independently says venkatasubramanian also southern california is more likely to experience a wildfire than a tsunami these types of differences will be considered during crisis modeling building human centered digital twins researchers usually predict a disaster s impact in a very mathematical sense says venkatasubramanian for example she says they might provide a mathematical modeling of a tsunami s inundation levels indicative of the height and speed of the incoming water flow but then how she asks do we assess the impact on the broader community the goal is to create a virtual disaster city that can not only map out the effects of a disaster but also analyze the impact on specific structures and the people within those structures including data on their health and mobility needs as we saw at ukedo elementary school everyone there could move to higher ground for safety explains venkatasubramanian but what if a main bridge had collapsed what if you were home alone in a wheelchair what if you were in a skilled nursing facility hooked up to a ventilator these are the kinds of questions our virtual cities hope to answer the team is working with japanese and california agencies with expertise in disaster resilience and aging populations such as the international research institute on disaster services irides in japan stakeholder workshops will enable the team to understand the older adult disaster landscape leading to research that integrates diverse geospatial and human centric data sources into a novel information architecture to enrich and align multiresolution spatiotemporal data executes physics driven hazard simulations and simulates disaster processes and consequences in virtual disaster cities focusing on an older population modeling communities and their interactions and needs as a digital twin for disaster response is a critical application with transformative impact for social good says mehrotra such modeling will include dealing with data incompleteness and uncertainty finding methods for timely data collection and planning and centering the required human elements advancing ditial twin technology in new and important directions furthermore the team will build on lessons learned from the caredex project another effort venkatasubramanian is leading caredex is a smart space platform for securely exchanging customized care information between first responders caregivers in senior housing facilities and older adults exploring interdisciplinary data driven solutions venkatasubramanian says that the larger goal of the digital twins project is to bring together a variety of stakeholders in exploring data driven solutions you have geologists tsunami experts engineers ai specialists and computer scientists professional caregivers government officials she says all looking at the sociological and societal contexts as we explore ways to build better technology solutions she touched on this effort in february when giving a keynote talk in sendai for the international conference on big data for disaster response and management in asia and the pacific sponsored by the asian development bank which invests in building climate resilience across more than 30 countries the talk focused on emerging technologies for enabling resilient cyber human infrastructure nalini venkatasubramanian third from left outside the international research institute on disaster services irides building while attending the international conference on big data for disaster response and management in asia and the pacific such infrastructure could support a variety of populations across the globe experiencing a range of disasters from floods to wildfires although the digital twins project is looking at a very specific context we re also considering what solutions translate across the international community and plan to expand our findings more globally says venkatasubramanian we need to understand the structure of the community and its policies to simulate a variety of different scenarios to help people better prepare shani murray categories academicscomputer sciencenewsresearch tags digital twindisaster digital twindisaster sciencenalini

design it is critical to understand how the intervention effect varies over time and with contextual information this study aims to assess how a push noti cation suggesting physical activity in uences individuals step counts using data from the heartsteps micro randomized trial mrt the statistical challenges include the time varying treatments and longitudinal functional step count measurements we propose the rst semiparametric causal excursion effect model with varying coef cients to model the time varying effects within a decision point and across decision points in an mrt the proposed model incorporates double time indices to accommodate the longitudinal functional outcome enabling the assessment of time varying effect moderation by contextual variables we propose a two stage causal effect estimator that is robust against a misspeci ed high dimensional outcome regression nuisance model we establish asymptotic theory and conduct simulation studies to validate the proposed estimator our analysis provides new insights into individuals change in response pro les such as how soon a response occurs due to the activity suggestions how such changes differ by the type of

glassdoor s list of the 50 best jobs in american for 2020 which shouldn t be too surprising given the rise of big data and growing demand for empirical based decision making across many industries to help meet this demand the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics is currently accepting applications for the new master of data science mds program it is launching in the fall of 2021 anyone interested in joining the inaugural cohort of this 15 month professional graduate program can apply online the early application deadline is december 15th 2020 after that applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until april 15th 2021 we see lots of demand coming from individuals who were trained in computer science for example without rigorous statistical training says daniel gillen chair of the department of statistics we also see demand coming from individuals who were trained in mathematical sciences and statistics but don t have the computing background he continues and then there are a lot of individuals coming from other disciplines as well from business analytics backgrounds and from political and social science backgrounds so whether you re in the tech industry at a financial institution in a domain such as education or healthcare or a recent graduate looking for more training this program is designed to advance your data science skills while there are minimum course requirements the goal is to fill certain gaps in training while providing practical hands on experience what makes this program unique is that it is going to be taught and delivered by world renowned experts in the foundations of data science meaning both statistics and computing says gillen the courses will cover applied probability and mathematical statistics statistical modeling and computing machine learning data management and visualization and artificial intelligence more importantly they will be evenly split between faculty from the department of statistics and the department of computer science both of which are housed in the school of ics industry is learning very quickly that a lot of people can scrape and analyze data but to do something truly meaningful with data to make decisions that will drive the industry forward you really have to have a basic foundational understanding of the methods you re using says gillen that is what drives the philosophy of this degree the program spans five quarters with the first three quarters comprising coursework in both statistics and computer science the summer quarter is available for internships or additional courses to accommodate working professionals all courses will be offered in the late afternoon or evening and for those in need of financial assistance scholarships and financial aid are available the final quarter is the capstone course where students will work on industry derived projects gaining real world hands on experience we plan to partner with businesses to help generate not only contacts for students but also interesting capstone projects if your business is interested in sponsoring a capstone project please contact bryan munoz at mds ics uci edu furthermore because this program adds to the list of successful professional programs already offered through the school of ics students will have access to dedicated career counselors and will participate in showcase events so while the goal is to keep the initial mds cohort relatively small students will be able to leverage resources and events available through the established graduate programs it will be fairly selective so we re aiming at 50 students for the first cohort says gillen though that might grow in future years this select group of students will gain experience in using relevant data related software and technologies so they can thrive as data scientists whether their goal is to work in the tech industry or government or anywhere in between we re going to focus on taking what is learned about the foundations of these disciplines stresses gillen and applying them to real world data shani murray a campus gem uci s statistical consulting servicesa look at health and technology trends for 2021 and

statistics current course listings news seminars news seminar center for statistical consulting a look at health and technology trends for 2021 and beyond january 15 2021 the fields of computer science informatics and statistics have been influencing healthcare for decades and 2020 served as an important reminder of the critical role both healthcare and technology play in people s daily lives the covid 19 pandemic put a spotlight on healthcare while stay at home orders significantly boosted technology use in general and telehealth practices in particular looking to the new year ahead how might the connections between technology and health become further entwined and how will this impact the future of healthcare here to address these questions are three professors from the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics yunan chen associate professor of informatics whose research focuses on human computer interaction hci computer supported cooperative work cscw and health informatics nikil dutt distinguished professor of computer science who studies embedded systems healthcare iot computer aided design and brain inspired architectures and computing and bin nan professor of statistics who works to improve human health through the development of statistical and machine learning methods professors chen dutt and nan each discuss new opportunities and challenges as advances in technology lead to fundamental shifts in the healthcare industry how is your field influencing the healthcare industry and what changes do you expect to see in the next few decades yunan chen chen informatics has had a huge influence on the healthcare industry the medical field is centered on the use of information in fact the field of medical informatics was established to meet the growing demand to collect access and use health data and information in the past five to 10 years health it systems have almost completely transformed paper based medical practices into electronic health records as everything becomes digitalized huge amounts of information and data can be collected and shared across practices opening the door to new clinical research and health policies another major influence stems from the digitalization of our everyday life with advances in consumer facing health it applications individuals can now collect manage and use personal health data that was not available in the past this information can then be shared with clinicians to benefit their practices across different settings clinical home or communities informatics research and applications are helping people better access information gather data and engage in evidence based practices leading to improved public health nikil dutt dutt one big shift we re seeing is this notion of digital health the idea of using technology for better self care it s this whole idea that even the field of medicine is recognizing called p4 health which is predictive preventive personalized and participatory health instead of the traditional model of episodic healthcare where you go to the doctor or er when you re sick we re moving toward proactively shifting the emphasis to earlier phases in terms of lifestyle digital health technologies including computer science informatics and statistics are the key enablers moving us in that direction we ve always talked about personalized health but now technology lets us use data and statistics to build models of individuals that can improve the quality of healthcare by delivering services in a more targeted fashion another tremendous shift we have seen just this past year is the move to remote healthcare and telehealth covid 19 accelerated the move to delivering services using technology the other thing that we ll be soon talking about is integrating mental and physical health far too often physical and mental care are siloed and services are provided in a completely uncoordinated fashion so i see a big change with personalization and this ability to integrate all of that information in a manner that can help healthcare professionals better do their jobs and more importantly help individuals empower themselves to make decisions in an informed manner bin nan nan statistics plays a very important role in any health related research the field of so called biostatistics is evidence of that where the emphasis is on health and medical research i can name many interesting influential topics such as survival analysis and longitudinal data analysis in the past two decades technology has evolved so that people can perform fine sequencing of dna information there are also many impacts along the lines of imaging especially in neuroscience research the brain is a very interesting organ that you usually cannot access so you can t directly measure brain activity you have to rely on imaging in both areas massive data are generated and that motivates some interesting statistical research in a fast growing area called high dimensional statistics in the coming years people will increasingly use wearable devices to track data including activity data and heartbeat and temperature measurements this presents statistical challenges in terms of how you analyze the data and how you design interventions to improve human health such as a message that says you should exercise more or you need to relax i m part of uci s new institute for future health ifh led by ramesh jain and the focus is on trying to understand how we collect and use mobile device data to improve health this will be a very interesting field that s depending on technology involvement as wearable devices with well designed apps become more and more available to people so we call this the big data era new statistical methods are being developed and some of them will become much more impactful in these scientific areas which will certainly reshape scientific knowledge in the future what about covid 19 s influence how did the global pandemic impact your research chen covid is not only a global public health crisis but also an information crisis our past research in this area shows that during a public health crisis information is often uncertain and ambiguous challenging how people perceive personal risks and make decisions it is crucial for informatics researchers like us to examine the use of information and technologies during this challenging time i ve been doing a multicultural study on contact tracing technologies for covid 19 in the u s korea and japan working with informatics professor daniel epstein and a group of international collaborators we started looking at human tracers and technology tracers and under different conditions when people prefer humans versus technology one of our findings to be presented at chi 21 is that when people have to report their symptoms during a 14 day quarantine they prefer technology check ins but when being notified of a covid positive diagnosis or of exposure to the virus people prefer to talk to a human so they can ask questions and receive emotional assurance right now we re doing a similar study in korea and also a survey in japan as they recently rolled out their national covid tracing system i ve also worked on a collaborative project looking into people s risk perceptions during the pandemic and how those perceptions might change as the pandemic wears on again findings to be presented at chi 21 in another study we looked into the beliefs of those who oppose facial masks we used a combination of machine learning and qualitative content analysis methods to analyze twitter data from january to october 2020 this study reveals the temporal trend of public opinions and the reasons why some people do not support mask wearing helping us understand public concerns and learn how to better communicate health policies to the public dutt one of the big projects i m working on is called unite underserved communities which provides services so that underserved pregnant women can take better care of themselves the project uses what we call a community health worker model where a community health worker traditionally goes in and visits with the mom periodically what we were looking at is how wearable technology can provide ubiquitous continuous monitoring that closes the loop by augmenting what happens during the physical visits we re doing the pilot study now so covid actually allowed us to test this intervention which became even more important when health workers could no longer visit the women at their homes so i think that provided us with an opportunity to test it and show that digital services can help people in this instance pregnant moms take better care of themselves also together with psychology professor jesse borelli we were looking at stress management of college kids we started this before covid recruiting between 10 to 30 students for each cohort using a combination of physiological monitoring with wearables and ecological momentary assessment ema questionnaires delivered on an app we combined the students physical health with their mental health state to evaluate and track their stress levels over time and provide feedback as covid hit we saw huge rises in stress levels it was extremely important to see what these kids were going through but it s also very exciting to use these digital technologies to build a personalized model nan covid did not interrupt my research too much since most of my research activities are now on zoom meanwhile i got a chance to work with professor jonathan watanabe from the uci school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences who is interested in how doctors treat covid 19 patients he was trying to understand the patterns of different medicine use over time among different patient categories the data set that we used was from the electronic health records another source of big data for health research of the uc system we have five medical schools and many many hospitals in the uc system and we have access to that data which is updated on a daily basis about what medicines were prescribed to the patients this is observational and descriptive not a clinical evaluation but it s very interesting work covid 19 has also highlighted racial disparities in healthcare what role do you think racial justice plays in healthcare and technology chen it definitely plays a huge role there have been recent studies outside of the healthcare world about how if the training data of ai systems does not include a certain population then the algorithms developed based on such data might lead to potential bias in the healthcare field i could imagine such scenarios in future ai assistant practices if the systems don t have enough training data for underrepresented populations or economically disadvantaged communities that could lead to serious consequences since we don t have universal healthcare in the u s it s really hard for some people to afford certain treatments for example infertility treatments if a technology is developed based on patient data with participation only by people who can afford it then bias can be embedded into the design i ve also seen studies looking into how technology can help clinicians avoid implicit bias when treating patients if they subconsciously describe things differently to different patients or maybe use a different tone or style of interaction if we look at the future of the entire healthcare industry and insurance more broadly there have been some articles about how if you are inherently prone to develop some kind of disease based on your medical history we would have different kinds of insurance that s one of the ethical issues we discuss in my medical informatics class with more algorithms and decision support being deployed in the healthcare field we need to be careful to not widen health disparity or inequity through technology design dutt that s so important we have a planning grant with nursing colleagues professor amir rahmani and dean adey nyamathi for a new nsf program called the future of work our grant digital health for future of community centered care is looking at community centered care because we all know that a large part of the cost of healthcare comes from training doctors and nurses but if you look at underserved populations community workers are the ones who actually interface with people and then report back to nurses or doctors so we feel that technology can empower and grow these types of services to help underserved communities especially in this climate so you asked what role does racial justice play and i m kind of turning that around saying technology has a tremendous role to play in providing services for the most underserved communities an example is the work we re doing through unite with moms orange county but i think we can take that kind of model and scale it i ll give you two instances that we ve discussed one is looking at mechanisms to help deliver services to the homeless community and another one is the meals on wheels program which delivers food to typically underserved elderly populations and these individuals are not only underserved but also might be going through life changes where they may be having early onset of dementia or they might not be taking care of themselves so how can we use technology to help identify problems early and communicate and address that nan in healthcare we see racial discrepancies all the time for example i was involved in a project looking at medicare data for end stage renal disease patients usually the standard treatment is dialysis for this cms centers for medicare medicaid services project we developed measures to evaluate the performance of dialysis facilities one of the issues we often see is racial discrepancy it s always there sometimes disparities can be explained biologically different genetic makeup for example but many are actually due to the social economic status how to address that is the billion dollar question people of color have disadvantages in terms of access to quality healthcare which directly impacts their health status there s a big debate about universal healthcare but i think that in a rich country like the u s everyone should have a certain level of care what other major challenges do we as a society need to address in the next five years chen now that we are able to collect a large amount of personal health data both by healthcare professionals and consumers the major challenge we face is how to better utilize such data to meet the diverse needs of stakeholders we often hear clinicians complaining about not having enough time to review the data patient brought to the clinic or patients being confused or distressed by their own health data there are structured constraints in our healthcare system that do not allocate physicians enough time to perform the data work brought on by new technologies on the consumer side users might not have sufficient knowledge skills and literacy to manage their own data and health how do we design health it systems that both provide data access as well as allow appropriate use of such data avoiding unintended negative consequences so beyond the technical aspect the human and social aspects of design are even more important how do you visualize and present the data to different stakeholders sometimes the systems also generate suggestions or predictions you might get diabetes if you continue leading this kind of lifestyle or if a prediction says you won t get pregnant in the next five days do you trust it and who is taking responsibility for the consequences we need to design technologies to not only collect data but also present it in a way that makes sense and that addresses diverse users data needs and to let users understand their data instead of over trusting it we did a fertility technology study and found the technology implicitly placed both physical and emotional burden on individuals trying to conceive many apps were following social norms making the women not their partners track the data but is that really the right way to do it so that s part of the challenge we need more experts who can connect both the technical side and the medical health side to create better healthcare technologies dutt one of the biggest challenges is finding how we move from episodic event based medical care to a model that s more integrated holistic and proactive this requires us to personalize the model to the individual spanning not only biomarkers to show if you re at risk for say heart disease but also the mental health aspect breaking down siloed healthcare to deliver integrated services will be critical this challenge transcends computer science and goes to the root of how policymakers and the government look at and fund healthcare in society if you look at how we re trying to achieve this vision of empowering people and developing personal models we can do that in smaller pilot studies but achieving it in practice is a huge challenge the other major barrier is privacy which varies not only from person to person but also very importantly as a person s health condition changes i m a healthy young adult and i m invincible so i don t want to share my data but you take an aging individual and there you get into all kinds of issues maybe in principle they don t want to share their health information but because of their condition they might need to maybe they re suffering from dementia it s a very complicated issue so how can we develop policies and infrastructures that can manage the privacy requirements of healthcare as the health state of an individual changes over time that s a very interesting aspect that colleagues here including professor sharad mehrotra have been working on nan again focusing on statistical research in health one of the greatest challenges in the next five years will be better understanding deep learning ai algorithms and being able to do some sort of reliable statistical inference on those models deep learning algorithms have been very successful in many areas of health research especially in radiology there are many interesting examples of the machine doing better than even the best trained radiologists when you have huge amounts of data you can train the algorithm to do more precise diagnoses but one challenge from the statistical side is trying to understand the effects of the predictors for example the risk factors to a disease statisticians build simple models that are easily interpretable but deep learning algorithms are usually a black box type of thing we don t really know what s going on inside the black box the algorithm can usually achieve a pretty good prediction but we still need to understand it more in order to find modifiable risk factors to improve people s health or to gain knowledge of disease mechanisms so we ll need statisticians and computer science researchers working together to open the black box finally what research will you be focused on in the coming year chen i m going to continue focusing on data driven technologies and examining the data work of individuals engaging in their everyday health practices we re doing a project on asthma with one of my ph d students imagine you have an inhaler that tracks your locations and notes where you take medications and senses certain environmental variables so how do individuals their caregivers and their healthcare providers benefit from such data and how can we design the right technologies to support their data work increasingly these data driven technologies are coupled with ai to provide algorithmic advice such as suggestions or predictions if the app tells you when and where you are more likely to have an asthma attack would you trust and follow such a prediction how do you make sure that the ai is accurate so i think on both the clinical and patient sides that s a really interesting direction i ll be working on including as it relates to smart health technology such as the smart diaper that tells you when it needs to be changed or the smart app that predicts your fertility window or tells you when to feed your baby increasingly society which is enthusiastic about data and ai is going to push for changes in how we manage our health and lifestyles so we need to make sure these technologies are designed properly dutt some exciting projects are in the works through the new institute for future health ifh we talked about unite and mental health and another area is food because what we eat can affect our mood and our physical health so a new line of research we ve started looking into together with professors ramesh jain and amir rahmani in the school of nursing relates to the new topic of food computing another ongoing effort is in pain assessment where we are trying to quantify the level of pain for subjects who are not able to communicate such as people just coming out of surgery or neonatal infants this will help doctors and nurses determine whether to administer pain medication and how much we re doing a small study with the uci medical center looking at some post operative patients to create a baseline and build a model using facial monitoring and measuring facial muscles and sweat and heart rate it s very exciting finally using data sets that we can access through the uc system we re doing covid detection intervention and prediction studies so it s quite a portfolio of projects and i am really excited that i m at uci it s a pleasure to wake up every morning and work with all these really bright people nan my personal research is on aging in general and alzheimer s disease in particular one of the problems i m thinking about is how to estimate alzheimer s disease prevalence a challenging issue is in survival analysis which is my field of interest the commonly used mathematical models implicitly assume that people can live forever you don t say people have to die before age 150 even though that s what we observe in the real world in fact that kind of modeling assumption is very hard to handle for aging studies which focus on the end of life so the idea i m proposing is to look at people who have already died to see who developed the disease during their lifetime and who didn t where the lifetimes are finite that s clearer information trying to understand during a lifetime who developed the disease when it happened and how it relates to certain risk factors it s natural to ask the question in a forward way how many people will get the disease in the next five years but my way of thinking is also going backwards looking at people s entire lifetimes to hopefully provide more precise estimation about this disease and a better evaluation of risk factors this is a new framework totally different from what people have been doing in the past and hopefully it will lead to important discoveries shani murray uci launches new professional program master of data scienceamstat news celebrating women in statistics 2021 annie qu

s really a career path in sports related to uci s data science major if so the webinar series being offered by the sport statistics group uci through the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics should be of interest to you the next webinar to be held on may 21 2021 will feature brendan kent a senior business data analyst at draftkings and creator and host of the measurables podcast there s a lot of interest around sports research right now says statistics professor michele guindani who is helping ph d student corey brett katz lead the new group along with statistics professors hal stern and weining shen sports excites many people so we ve started hosting seminars to introduce students to the types of problems one might work on in sports stats providing a behind the scenes look at sports statsin the february webinar presenting sports research to an average sports fan espn senior sports analytics specialist paul sabin talked about the work that goes into providing the game predictions shared by espn newscasters and appearing on the channel s news ticker the sport statistics group s february webinar featured espn senior sports analytics specialist paul sabin in particular he recounted his first few months at espn when he was tasked with improving the college basketball power index bpi leading into the 2016 ncaa basketball tournament using a bayesian model with coefficients such as home team or away team and distance traveled he did a posterior predictive distribution which espn started using for its on air predictions after the final four games for the men s tournament the model sabin developed gave villanova a 50 1 chance to win the championship over north carolina people don t realize that 50 1 and 49 9 are essentially the same thing statistically they ve very similar explained sabin regardless the prediction running along the bottom of the espn channel had villanova with its 50 1 favored to win when you work in sports you start having these rooting interests that have nothing to do with anything rational admitted sabin who had no ties to either school and didn t really care who won yet based on his model espn had predicted a villanova win so he suddenly became very invested in that outcome i have never been more nervous than i was at this moment he replayed the moment he was referring to during the webinar transporting viewers to the final seconds of the 2016 championship just as north carolina tied the game well my model was very close 50 and the game is tied with five seconds left he recalled thinking at the time that s what the highest probability was this outcome but i also wanted people to not lose trust in me villanova then won the game with a buzzer beater basket the game had an incredible finish said sabin and the espn prediction had been correct there s more to the story including a statistical twist and lessons learned so if you re affiliated with uci be sure to watch the recording with your ucnet id during the webinar sabin also talked about how it was sports that really generated my love of statistics in the first place and he explained how using sports analogies helped him make sense of difficult concepts in college when he couldn t grasp the idea of n dimensional space he thought of it in terms of having five different variables and trying to predict the outcome of a game it s easier to understand concepts if applied to a passion like sports he said which he views as opportunity for introducing new students to statistics i m a big believer that using sports can help increase diversity in stem education guindani similarly views sports as a potential recruitment tool it s an area that provides opportunities for getting students excited about statistics leveraging sports webinars for recruitmentsabin s talk was one of a series of webinars offered by the sport statistics group recordings of the other webinars are available online with your ucnet id career paths in statistics with luke bornn co founder and chief scientist of zelus analytics recording data and statistics in baseball what it s like to work in a baseball analytics department with kevin ferris of

earlier the next webinar will feature brendan kent of draftkings and creator the measurables educational sports analytics and sports tech podcast while a ucnet id is required to view recordings of previous events the live webinars are open to anyone from high school students exploring potential majors and career options to professional sports analysts or even international statisticians visit the events page for log in information however the long term goal of these webinars is to help recruit a dedicated group of uci students interested in working on a variety of projects related to sports stats the hope is that students after watching a webinar will get involved with the sport statistics uci group any uci students can join the group all ics students are welcome as well as students who might be majoring in a different field e g economics or psychology says guindani it would be awesome to put together a group that could eventually collaborate with uci s athletics

capstone course in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics was in 2009 with 19 students from the department of informatics working on five project teams now more than a decade later the informatics capstone course is offered three times a year and ics has added undergraduate capstone courses for its computer science and data science majors it also offers capstone courses through its master of human computer interaction and design mhcid master of computer science mcs and master of software engineering mswe professional programs even with the global pandemic moving people out of classrooms and offices and into online spaces this past year more than 130 ics capstone projects were successfully completed tremendous growth we re growing in leaps and bounds says informatics professor hadar ziv who led that first capstone course so many years ago this growth was on full display at the ics spring 2021 capstone student design showcase where nine of the 12 projects presented were a mere sampling of the more than 60 projects completed for the undergraduate informatics computer science and data science capstone programs this year you can view many of the student capstone videos online it was hard to select projects for the showcase because they all were very competitive says professor sergio gago masague who led the new computer science capstone and its 16 projects after a successful pilot version last year the course has already grown from 50 to 70 students and gago masague plans to scale it up again next year the capstone required for the data science major the first such undergraduate degree program offered in the uc system resulted in 14 projects created by 42 students this year the course is co taught by two faculty members each year one from the computer science department and one from the statistics department the balanced and rigorous curriculum of the data science major allows students to take on a wide range of ambitious capstone projects ranging from predicting medical treatment effects using electronic health records to using time series techniques to forecast product demand stresses statistics professor vladimir minin who directed the data science program the last three years starting july 1 2021 statistics professor mine dogucu will take the helm of the program the other three projects presented at the capstone student design showcase were award winning designs from the butterworth design competition a software development competition open to ics students the top prize and 10 000 was awarded to the grasshopper fund a startup marketplace and funding platform ics has also witnessed growth at the graduate level with the mcs spring 2021 capstone showcase featuring 18 different projects one of which armory took third place in the butterworth design competition mcs students working on the armory interactive platform which lets developers experiment with various cybersecurity threats so they can proactively write secure code were awarded 3 500 this year another seven projects were completed for the mhcid program and a joint mcs and mswe winter showcase in december presented 46 projects ten of which were created by the inaugural mswe cohort of 34 students quantity and qualitythe growing number of projects isn t the only impressive element of the ics capstone program the quality of the projects is also increasing says jason king associate director of corporate relations in ics we re seeing more success stories on both the student and sponsor side as we refine the capstone process and devote more time up front to setting up the projects this benefits the students faculty and corporate sponsors we re not just doing projects to do projects he says we re ensuring students gain the hands on experience and soft skills needed for future success ziv agrees a couple of my teams were not only the best in their class but among the best i ve taught in 12 years or so he said referring to the adventure biofeedback project where students created a game environment to make speech therapy for kids fun and the dreams for schools project where students helped a nonprofit stem education program scale up its operations the game environment for the adventure biofeedback project in developing the speech therapy application computer software engineering major eduardo magdaleno said it was an opportunity for him to apply all of my culminated skills that i learned during my four years at uci he was able to practice agile development project management hci and more while working closely with the stakeholders i did demos and user testing and learned that talking and eliciting the right questions was very important so our application could be built with the users in mind informatics major stella adriana who helped design an instructor assignment sorter for dreams for schools similarly talked during the showcase about how the project helped her learn how to effectively communicate with developers google software engineer tim laubach one of more than 120 participants at the online capstone student design showcase stressed the importance of the students learning this lesson the most beautiful design in the world if it can t be implemented doesn t help the user gaining this practical hands one experience is what the capstone courses are all about there are things we just can t teach in a traditional classroom the capstone course gives students a leg up as they transition out of their undergraduate degree and into their careers says informatics lecturer matthew bietz who taught one of the capstone courses this year even those who already have a background in industry have a lot to gain from the capstone experience working on this project has expanded my knowledge of agile development and working on a team which will be significant in my career progression says mcs student uddeshya kumar who worked on an artistic photos application to help people create art from photos this project gave me the opportunity to learn new technologies that align with my professional goals and will prove to be crucial in the near future a presentation of the artistic photos application the project sponsors are yet another beneficiary of the capstone courses project sponsors tell me again and again how happy they are to have worked with the students says bietz some sponsors come from nonprofits and just this quarter our students built apps to help victims of trafficking to support parents of children with developmental disabilities and to help cancer patients better understand their treatment using 3d visualization to name just a few he says some sponsors join us from startups or larger tech companies and in addition to creating marketable products working with the students is a way to identify individuals they want to recruit this form of networking is invaluable to students and sponsors alike for all of the skill building and new knowledge the students get says bietz the real impacts of the capstone program lie in building relationships careers and passions if you are a company interested in sponsoring an undergraduate or

second ever virtual ceremony nevertheless represented something extraordinary the class of 2021 will have a unique place in our institutional memory as the most resilient and responsive class we have ever had the privilege of teaching said chancellor howard gillman during his opening remarks under the most extraordinary circumstances you rose to the occasion supported each other adapted and persisted as gillman lamented the physical separation of the occasion instead of the traditional gathering in the bren center he emphasized that no matter our physical circumstances we are right now anteaters together marking this great moment in your life graduates of the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics heard a similar sentiment from dean marios c papaefthymiou in his welcome for the ics ceremony ics expects to confer more than 1 200 undergraduate and 100 graduate degrees this year although the hybrid nature of this commencement is not as gratifying as an in person live ceremony the significance of the event remains as strong as ever said papaefthymiou as the class of 2021 transitioned from students to graduates joining a network of more than 10 000 ics alumni papaefthymiou spoke of their larger role in society our aspiration is that you re graduating from our program equipped to make a positive impact on our world using technology to do good and leading in creating a better future for everyone four student commencement speakers then recalled their anteater journeys starting with tiffany kong although kong has already secured a position as an engineer at qualcomm she admitted that she had no intention of graduating with a bachelor s degree in computer science when she first came to uci i never really thought about working in the tech or software industry let alone majoring in computer science but i did know three things i enjoyed math i enjoyed art and i really wanted to attend uci she told her fellow classmates through computer science i came to enjoy a variety of topics such as ai and hci because they provide a perfect blend between art and design and math and technology she spoke of both the devastation she felt after failing ics 32 as well as the courage she mustered to successfully retake the course for me failing a class seemed like a nightmare or even now for us graduating into a pandemic it s hard to get out of that doomsday mindset she said however this is what has made us stronger all these challenges that we have gone through have proven to us that we have never let doubt consume us similar to kong software engineering graduate jennifer kwon also found her passion at uci after taking a project management course my time at uci has brought me invaluable skills and i couldn t have asked for a better experience here she said she was driven to succeed taking courses over summer to continue her learning her senior capstone class provided one of her most memorable experiences as she conducted a research study in collaboration with the children s hospital of orange county to make speech therapy fun for kids the project was recently highlighted during the ics spring 2021 capstone student design showcase kwon

his journey to this moment born with autism i m so grateful today to receive my bachelor s degree after studying for five and a half years he said noting that learning algorithms and programming c and systemverilog was especially difficult for him requiring more than twice the time needed for other students yet he persevered i truly feel that any goal is possible if we put our mind heart and soul into it he told his classmates my biggest wish today is to encourage you whether autistic or not to always have hope kindness and perseverance so the highest purpose can be reached first generation low income latino student francisco loya spoke of the resilience of this class of 2021 in particular a bird sitting in a tree is never afraid of the branch breaking because her trust is not in the branch but in her own wings said the computer science graduate the students who have gone through uci before us have passed tough classes met great people and graduated each and every one of us has done the same but have done so while assisting sick family members getting internships and job offers rescinded and fighting for equality he noted so yes we are now graduating with a degree but the strongest asset we ve proven that we have is grit and a strong work ethic the class of 2021 is indeed unique in having overcome the yearlong upheaval caused by the global pandemic each graduating student whose name was read with pomp and circumstance playing in the background as their slide flashed on the screen has their own story of overcoming challenges in earning their ics degree particularly during their final year in the program yet each and every one showed great determination in reaching this moment and will forever share a special place in history as that most resilient

been known for its impressive machine learning repository with more than 580 publicly accessible datasets the repository serves as a tremendous resource for empirical and methodological research in machine learning it also serves as a great learning tool for uci students thanks to the second annual ml hackathon a student competition funded by the national science foundation the uci research community donated nine challenge datasets from the repository for the event and the research cyberinfrastructure center rcic provided the computational resources we wanted to create a fun opportunity for students to engage with real projects within the uci research community says tamanna hossain a graduate student in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics who organized this year s hackathon my favorite part of the event was definitely the enthusiasm and curiosity students brought to the table especially under the difficult conditions of the ongoing covid 19 pandemic ten teams participated in the virtual hackathon held may 14 through may 23 2021 and competed for the top prize of 500 for best overall and for four 250 prizes awarded for technical skills scientific insights creativity and best presentation yu miyauchi award winning hacksthe top prize went to hatomugi an ml model designed to detect fake reviews on yelp developed by data science major yu miyauchi the model leveraged the yelpnyc challenge dataset which contains 359 052 yelp reviews for restaurants in new york city miyauchi who graduated in june and is now a data analysis consultant at deloitte says this competition was a great way to simulate my future work yu miyauchi explaining his machine learning model for fake review detection in yelp qingchuan yang yihan wang another hack using the yelpnyc data was aces2alliance which won the technical skills award data science major yihan wang and computer science major qingchuan yang applied deep learning algorithms to predict whether an unlabeled yelp review was real or fake i was not expecting to win the award at the end says wang but i am grateful to ics for giving the current students a platform to showcase the skills we have learned yang added that it was exciting to apply ml theories learned from lectures to practice and see how powerful they are andrew chen the award for scientific insights went to i am a segmentation fault developed by computer science major andrew chen using the dataset containing climate change and ecosystem carbon information in california i created a regressor that predicts carbon densities in california based on projected temperature and precipitation conditions he says this event was a great opportunity to use the theoretical machine learning skills that we heard about in class on real world data sets richard lopez and rionel dmello the most creative hack was two truths and a lie developed by computer science majors rionel dmello and richard lopez given a misconception and tweet pair our goal was to detect if that tweet propagates the misconception allowing content moderation on social media the students used the covidlies dataset of approximately 6 000 tweet and misconception pairs and fasttext a shallow neural network to extract word embeddings i enjoyed working on a project that was so closely related to the pandemic and i understand the challenges that big tech faces in regard to reducing the spread of misinformation says dmello my partner and i also had to come up with innovative ways to communicate and share information over various platforms which was a challenge in itself lopez agrees working on a covid related project in the middle of the pandemic was quite an adventure randy huynh top left ruslan manahoran top right and william hou another hack using the covidlies dataset was wtawtaw which won the presentation award for this hack first year computer science students randy huynh and ruslan manahoran along with first year data science student william hou focused on characterizing common covid 19 misconceptions and developing a model to detect their presence covid 19 has had such a huge impact on our lives and all around the world and it was really interesting to explore how rampant covid 19 misinformation is on the internet says the teammates through our research we were able to determine commonalities between misinformative tweets such as word and phrase choice types of misinformation certain themes etc we hope our project will contribute to the development of more robust misinformation detection models in the future advancing ml researchin addition to the competition the event included ml research talks by computer science professor sameer singh and computer science ph d students sam showalter anthony chen dylan slack and gavin kerrigan singh chancellor s professor padhraic smyth and rcic director philip papadopoulos served as faculty mentors throughout the event and because all of the projects completed were open source the hackathon work contributed to ml research as well this is an amazing opportunity for undergraduates not only to gain hands on experience with applying machine learning to real problems which can really help them get jobs in machine learning but further working on scientific problems offered by uci faculty means that the undergraduates are helping advanced research i wish i had such opportunities as an undergrad says singh it is also a great opportunity for the faculty across campus to use our excellent ics undergraduates to prototype what applying ml to their projects would look

receiving the george cobb award on july 27 2021 utts received the dinsdale award from the society for scientific exploration sse she learned of the honor at sse pa connections 2021 a joint online conference between the sse and the parapsychological association pa established in 1992 the award named after tim dinsdale recognizes significant contributions to the expansion of human understanding through the study of unexplained phenomena it aims to reward senior scholars who have significantly contributed to our understanding of anomalous physical biological and psychological events in the spirit of meticulous research exemplary methodology and proper scholarly attitude utts received the award for significant contributions in the rigorous application of statistical methods to the study of psi shorthand for parapsychology including remote perception presentiment and distant healing i was delighted to have my work recognized by receiving the dinsdale award and was particularly pleased that the awardee immediately preceding me was hal puthoff who first introduced me to this research area says utts who met puthoff many years ago at an see conference puthoff was the director of the government funded research program studying psychic abilities and their possible use for intelligence gathering he was looking for a statistical consultant for a program based out of sri international utts became a consultant for the program and still collaborates with parapsychology researchers to this day about half of my research publications are related to my work in parapsychology she says noting that her most prominent work was a report she put together for congress my work was a part of the full report evaluating the government work on psychic abilities commonly referred to by one of its code names stargate she says that report led to appearances on cnn larry king live and lots of other media outlets the dinsdale award appropriately spotlights how utts leveraged her ph d work in statistics and her undergraduate study of both math and psychology to push the boundaries of mainstream science and advance the field of parapsychology all while continuing to advance statistics

professional goals december 8 2021 women have been historically underrepresented in stem and that trend continues today the pew research center found that women make up 25 of computing occupations and girls make up approximately 30 of ap computer science test takers girls and women face a number of challenges in the stem field which is why uci s master of data science program aims to make stem more accessible to underrepresented groups our goal is to diversify the field of data science and break the mold we want to increase female representation in tech and also help improve social mobility for underrepresented groups in the u s mds program manager bryan mu oz said the mds program launched in fall 2021 welcomed 25 students in its inaugural class of 2022 thirty two percent of the first mds cohort are women one of them being adelynn paik who serves as one of five mds program ambassadors as ambassadors we act as representatives of the program to prospective students and potential company partners paik said we are also the first point of contact for many applicants so i hope to be a welcoming face for all to prospective mds program female candidates seeing how women like paik can thrive in computing fields is inspirational because they see how they too belong in stem having leaders and programs that strive to make stem more inclusive also helps change discriminatory attitudes that women often endure from not being taken seriously to experiencing sexist policies my challenges as a woman in stem started with two discrediting high school math teachers and have taken a number of different forms since then paik said i think the worst part is when the misogyny cannibalizes your mind and you start to make yourself small even without a perpetrator it takes work to choose not to be bitter or afraid some days more than others and to re center yourself in your own path in her position as an mds program ambassador paik hopes to contribute to the efforts to make the sciences more welcoming and supportive of women i can be part of the normalization of women excelling in this program especially in its infancy she said alongside making data science less unfamiliar to potential female students another goal that paik wants to achieve in the mds program is expanding her knowledge of data science while developing a burgeoning focus on one specific field paik s interest in data science comes from her longtime passion for stem particularly math and her undergraduate education at the massachusetts institute of technology mit she majored in systems engineering within mit s civil engineering department and received her degree in 2021 paik was also involved in two research groups at mit work of the future and glaciers group the first was the work of the future task force which was an interdisciplinary effort to analyze the impact of increasing automation on future jobs my mentor and i investigated automotive startup activity by collecting both qualitative and quantitative data paik said i was also briefly part of the glaciers group where i used computer vision to track the longitudinal movement of a glacier front as someone who decided to study systems engineering because she wanted to learn about how people move and live paik said the research she conducted at mit reflects her interests in the realms of city development transportation planning and the environment she added that her systems engineering education at mit which was rooted in mathematical and technical material translates well to her current graduate school education data science seems like the swiss army knife of majors in its applicability across fields i cannot think of an industry that doesn t make use of data in some way paik said at uci s mds program i m gaining useful skills while giving myself the chance to learn about the job landscape through offerings such as career counseling and the capstone project when paik isn t playing around with numbers you can find her taking classes on improv at the groundlings theatre school where she s a two time diversity scholarship recipient or doing stand up comedy i love that communal feeling of being in a cramped dimly lit room telling jokes to an audience and hanging out with other comedians as an asian american woman i find it s a great exercise in taking up space and defying the label that we are subservient she said what marries together the realms of comedy and stem for paik are how they empower women of color to be loud and let our talents represent us the optimism initiative and passion that paik has in her academics hobbies and beyond are sure to help her achieve her goals in the mds program in the short term i look forward to claiming a specialty within data science and starting a career in the environmental transportation healthcare or entertainment industry paik said my long term goal is to remain hopeful and work on projects with people i respect and admire karen phan disney

news seminar center for statistical consulting tech trends for 2022 january 10 2022 ics professors daniel epstein mohsen imani and tianchen qian discuss their research and the technological developments they expect in the coming year the new year starts with healthcare front and center as covid 19 continues to impact people s daily lives throughout the pandemic the fields of computer science informatics and statistics have all played an important role in helping people move their lives online stay connected and analyze vast amounts of data for informed decision making how will these fields continue to advance virtual and augmented spaces find new ways to bring people together and improve healthcare analytics and interventions in the coming year here to answer these questions while covering an array of topics including artificial intelligence ai wearables the aging population mental health and cybersecurity are three professors from the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics daniel epstein assistant professor of informatics and leader of the personal informatics everyday pie lab studies personal tracking technology and designs devices and apps that help people better track everything from health and fitness to finances and productivity mohsen imani assistant professor of computer science is working on a wide range of practical problems in the area of bio inspired computing machine learning computer architecture and embedded systems tianchen qian assistant professor of statistics works to develop methodology to understand causal relationships through the analysis of highly complex data with applications focusing on health and wearable technology the unique structure of ics as a standalone school with three departments computer science informatics and statistics makes it the perfect environment for exploring all aspects of computing and technology and the impact on society let s see what technological developments these three scholars expect to see in 2022 what technology advances are you most excited about as we head into 2022 daniel epstein epstein far from my area of expertise augmented reality has only recently become viable on people s everyday phones while i m skeptical that it will revolutionize the way we communicate with one another i m hopeful that it will help us create richer experiences once we find the right niches where the technology is really valuable i m also excited to hopefully see us take all of the big advances in conversational agents into important areas where people find them useful current research says they re mainly just used for setting timers and playing music my student lucas silva has been examining how voice assistants can make food journaling less burdensome and fit in with everyday technology use like using an alexa instead of your phone to log what you just ate while your hands are busy doing the dishes mohsen imani imani this pandemic has proven that virtual reality vr is an essential technology for our future communication vr will make significant changes in how we communicate with computers and each other it will shorten physical boundaries by giving us virtual feelings besides vr i am also excited to see the next generation of wearable devices and health monitoring technologies that could change the quality of healthcare systems tianchen qian qian i m most excited about the advances in wearable device and sensor technology and in particular their increasing applications in healthcare with these technology we are getting better at detecting the state of an individual such as stress level and location and potentially delivering behavior change interventions to them in real time this provides ample opportunity to improve health but also brings a lot of challenges such as how to balance the therapeutic effect of the interventions and the burden of receiving interventions through smartphone and wearable devices what is the next big challenge you think society will face and how will your field help epstein covid 19 forced us to radically restructure how we live and work with one another while there is certainly some appetite to return to normal for many people normal was worse or wasn t good either i think the big challenge for society is thinking through what changes for the better emerged from our situation and how do we not lose those in a foolhardy attempt to wipe the memory of the pandemic from the vantage point of informatics i particularly see us helping out in understanding how technology helped move activities that were in person to online and advocating for the things that became better from being online everything from online education to telemedicine to how people socialize with one another imani we face increasing needs for efficient and real time processing for diverse cognitive tasks using a vast volume of generated data deep learning and ai are predicted to make evolutionary changes in many areas including healthcare finance and cybersecurity to extract useful information applications often rely on sophisticated and costly machine learning and ai algorithms that lack transparency robustness and have long latency and high power consumption for realistic intelligent and effective systems to be developed and deployed there are crucial needs for scalable learning and computing methods on embedded devices for example algorithms that now run on large scale data centers with kilowatt power consumption need to be processed in real time on our daily used smart devices for example a smartwatch and smart glass this requires fundamental changes on the algorithm and underlying hardware qian the current one is obviously the pandemic which my colleagues have thoughtfully commented on the next big challenge in my view is the aging population and how to improve the quality of life for the elderly with longer life expectancy and lower birth rate the composition of the age pyramid is transitioning toward an older population and there are many challenges ahead how would the society take care of the elderly when a large proportion of the society are themselves old how can we empower the elderly with modern technology so that they can enjoy their lives without the assistance of another human for a longer period of time how can their quality of life be further improved while respecting the inevitable decline in physical and mental capabilities my collaborators from uci mind and i are investigating the early signs for alzheimer s disease and other cognitive disorders we are looking at the data from uci s 90 study where hundreds of individuals over 90 years old have been followed for years and have has their cognitive performance assessed over time we hope to identify features that can be used to predict cognitive disorders and bring new insights into the process everyone will face aging how is your field affecting people s day to day lives epstein in my mind informatics is at the forefront of taking technology advances and seriously thinking about how they can should and even shouldn t impact people s everyday lives in my specific area of personal health we re understanding how people feel about the well being technology they use every day and are testing out new ideas for improving those technologies based on research we ve seen health apps like apple health move from showing people pretty boring bar graphs of how much they walk each day to more useful insights and trends we ve also seen apps improve since earlier work in 2017 how they support people of more varied identities and goals such as menstrual health apps better supporting transgender and non binary individuals and all people across their health lifecycle some changes might feel subtle but they go a long way toward helping people get the health support they need from technology imani my research on hyperdimensional computing hdc aims to redesign algorithms using strategies that more closely model the human brain this new direction is an alternative paradigm that mimics important brain functionalities toward high efficiency and noise tolerant computation hdc is motivated by the observation that the human brain operates on high dimensional data representations hdc incorporates learning capability along with typical memory functions of storing loading information hdc has shown several advantages as the next generation of cognitive machines to enable human like intelligence first instead of requiring many iterations and data points for training hdc can learn in a single iteration from just a few examples second hdc operations are highly parallel and lightweight thus empowering online learning on our daily used smart devices finally hdc has a natural robustness to noise which is essential for current unreliable network and hardware technologies qian i would like to talk about the elephant in the room which is having a huge impact on people s day to day lives right now the covid 19 pandemic statistics has played an important role in our society s joint effort to combat covid 19 enabling us to efficiently and appropriately use data to make informed decisions it has helped us monitor cases model disease spread develop vaccines and assess their effectiveness establish guidelines on dosage and boosters and predict the future trajectory of the pandemic to guide policymaking what industry will experience the most changes based on computing advances in the next five years epstein like every year recently the question is which industries won t be heavily impacted by computing advances closest to my work i m expecting we ll reach an inflection point where healthcare takes more seriously what patients are experiencing outside of their clinical visits we re already seeing telehealth and messaging a doctor systems being widely available and used but i think we ll start seeing these systems extended to include more options for care for example at home covid tests have become big and i wouldn t be surprised to see those sorts of records be better digitized and structured to support population health but i also expect other industries will be seriously changed too imani there is no doubt that all industries will experience major changes using emerging ai techniques but i will highlight two in particular healthcare and cybersecurity ai powered health monitoring technology can help doctors prioritize patients and provide urgent care to those in the most danger thereby saving lives in addition such technology for example in the form of a lightweight wearable device like a bracelet also offers a convenient method for patients to monitor their own health ai technologies are also stepping in to help improve cyber resilience as security issues have started presenting a day to day struggle for businesses attackers are getting smarter so our cybersecurity must grow smarter too it is essential to deploy effective cybersecurity technology based on future machine learning algorithms with higher intelligence efficiency and human like reasoning capability qian i think one of them would be healthcare our healthcare model is transitioning from episodic event based care to integrated preventative and holistic care the advances in computation and ai are among the key facilitators for this transition with the rapid advances in wearable technology more and more people will be able to get care when and where they need it the most and i m not just talking about physical health mental health is an equally important aspect and its care stands to be greatly transformed by technology advances imagine someone who is trying to quit smoking wearable sensors nowadays allow us to use prediction algorithms to detect in real time when a user is stressed a big risk factor for relapse in smokers furthermore we now have the capability to immediately act on this real time prediction through digital interventions delivered through the wearable device or a smartphone such as recommending a mindfulness exercise to the individual to help reduce their stress level all these can be done without the involvement of another human being these type of smartphone and wearable based health interventions are also being developed in various other domains such as physical activity bipolar disorder substance abuse and so on i can only imagine how many more there will be in the next five years to transform healthcare and people s well being what research projects will you be focused on in the coming year epstein together with my students i m focused on moving people s health tracking practices beyond individual apps or experiences and into the complex circumstances where people use technology for example supported by an icts pilot award my student eunkyung jo is planning to bridge the gap between health data that patients collect and how doctors use that data we re planning to develop ways to annotate health questionnaires that your doctor might give you to fill out at home like symptom logs with your own data two of my other students dennis wang and xi lu are looking at what role social media should play in helping people get support and advice around the health data they collect and understanding why apps like myfitnesspal and weight watchers don t seem to be enough to serve those goals supported by snap research we ve been working on using data to help people who are meditating together become more aware of each other s mental states imani we aim to explore alternative computational models that enable further energy scaling by abandoning the deterministic requirement of today s computing systems these approaches will be particularly effective in the realization of cognitive functions such as recognition decision making and learning these functions are gaining rapid importance in a world that is infused with sensing modalities and in need of efficient information extraction qian my research focuses on the experimental design and statistical methods for developing mobile health interventions in particular i aim to develop efficient methods to utilize wearable data in order to answer the question of when where and under what context should a mobile health intervention be delivered one of the projects i will be focusing on in the coming year is a collaboration with professor pathik wadhwa from the uci school of medicine and other colleagues where we aim to develop just in time adaptive interventions for reducing stress among pregnant women and women of childbearing age this project involves building a prediction algorithm for detecting real time stress designing a micro randomized trial to collect data and constructing the algorithm to deliver the interventions in an optimal way on a more personal note what is your new year s resolution and is there anything from your bucket list you hope to cross off in 2022 epstein yikes big question i picked back up trail running this fall and did a few races for the first time in a while so my big goal there is to stick with staying active imani after two years of pandemic and remote working i believe it is finally the time to explore the world i am so excited to use summertime to travel with my family as helen keller once said life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all qian i just had a newborn in the summer of 2021 one of my new year s resolutions is to spend more time with my son and my family to cherish the moments when he is so little and so adorable

list of resources including on campus groups here at uci we also list some nationwide organizations and books that focus on diversity and race in technology as well as spotlight some black leaders in computer science and engineering both on and off campus when we think about black history month we usually begin by acknowledging those who have come before us and who are often overlooked in our society says gregory diggs yang assistant director of the stacey nicholas office of access and inclusion oai we should always honor those trailblazers but we should also recognize those great contributors who are currently widening the trail and those who are just beginning down it created in 2014 oai is a joint office between ics and the henry samueli school of engineering focused on recruiting retaining and graduating talented students from historically excluded populations the following is not meant to be an exhaustive list stresses diggs yang but rather a starting point for reflection during black history month and a way to recognize current black visionaries and new pioneers i am excited to be acknowledging the current unsung heroes of black history as it is being made

engineering and in the information and computer sciences in the samueli school of engineering assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering tayloria adams studies the physical properties of stem cell and cancer cell populations using innovative microfluidic devices her projects use electric currents and cell motion to develop membrane capacitance and other measurable cellular properties as reliable label free biological markers she holds a patent for her discoveries and was a national science foundation nsf postdoctoral fellow and uci chancellor s advance postdoctoral fellow adams recently earned a prestigious nsf career award and an award from the university of california cancer research coordinating committee also she is working with a multidisciplinary team to develop a curriculum focused on the meaningful engagement of minoritized students in the classroom this nsf funded grant led by pheather r harris director of uci s california alliance for minority participation is cutting edge and explores the environmental factors causing minoritized students to leave stem adams is also highly engaged in activities to increase the number of black high school undergraduate and graduate students pursuing stem fields black history month is very important to me says adams it s a chance for reflection on the strength of my ancestors which i channel into my research teaching and service i strive to be my ancestors wildest dreams and to influence the next generation of black engineers also in the samueli school of engineering assistant professor of biomedical engineering timothy downing is leading a team of interdisciplinary researchers working to uncover the molecular and physical principles of epigenome replication the project is funded through a 3 million nsf grant for research that seeks to better understand the dynamic nature of the epigenome which will open new possibilities for cellular engineering the award will also support activities that broaden participation in science among high schoolers and undergraduates including students from underrepresented groups in addition downing received 2 million in funding for a 2019 new innovator award with this work he aims to shed light on how mechanical cues integrate with and give rise to disease driving epigenetic mutations ultimately leading to the discovery of better treatment options for cancer patients black history month is a great opportunity for us all to reflect and remember to bring our full self into the edges of the social networks that we live and work in says downing it represents the idea that there s space in our society for everyone to exist and participate authentically when we do that incredible things happen in the school of ics assistant professor of informatics roderic crooks studies the intersections of race technology and public life his current project explores how community organizers in working class communities of color use data for activist projects even as they dispute the proliferation of data intensive technologies in education law enforcement financial services and other vital sites of civic concern the pursuit of science including information and computer sciences does not exempt anyone from participation in the complex dynamics and shared histories of anti black racism in the united states and across the world says crooks we are all deeply enmeshed in systems of power and privilege that benefit some and harm others based on interlocking hierarchies of citizenship wealth race class gender sexuality and disability i am encouraged by the increased willingness of our students to name these dynamics and to consider the study of structural oppression central to the work we do in ics also in the school of ics is ian harris who has been a professor in the department of computer science since 2004 his research interests include the design of secure hardware and software systems and the application of natural language understanding to security and design his current projects include the detection of phone based social engineering attacks the formalization of natural language specifications and the development of a cyber test range to evaluate the security of iot systems he is also leading a team of students participating in the mitre embedded capture the flag competition joni ricks oddie is the first full time director of the uci center for statistical consulting and is also director of the institute for clinical and translational sciences icts biostatistics epidemiology and research design berd unit by managing both ricks oddie who earned her ph d in epidemiology from ucla in 2012 has streamlined processes so the two groups operate in sync as a one stop shop for the uci community and affiliated organizations needing to collaborate with a statistician she works with a variety of organizations including chapman university and children s hospital of orange county and has organized many training sessions and workshops at uci she has a heart for working on diversity equity and inclusion dei related projects and is currently helping to lead the icts black thriving initiative strategic plan as well as working with faculty in the statistics department to expose underrepresented minority urm middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science every few decades our nation has a crisis of conscience as it pertains to its black citizenry says ricks oddie we change policies enact new laws develop diversity initiatives and commit to do better unfortunately each time the situation or crisis that initiated the movement ultimately gets forgotten and society moves on to some other more fashionable issue i truly hope this time we do not get weary in well doing and are able to sustain our commitment to making uci a place where black people are truly able to thrive and be their authentic selves shani murray 4 ics professors among 7 uci

wellness approach is giant leap in patient control improved outcomes irvine calif feb 15 2022 the university of california irvine today announced the launch of the institute for precision health an endeavor that marries uci s powerhouse health sciences engineering machine learning artificial intelligence clinical genomics and data science capabilities to deliver the most effective health and wellness strategy for each individual person and in doing so confronts the linked challenges of health equity and the high cost of care the institute will bring a multifaceted integrated approach to what many call the next great advancement in healthcare precision medicine collects patient data history exams demographics molecular and diagnostic tests and uses the power of computer algorithms predictive modeling and ai to develop personalized treatment and lifelong health maintenance plans what we re doing at the institute for precision health is perhaps the most important step we ll take in this generation to improve health and well being said steve a n goldstein m d ph d faap uci s vice chancellor for health affairs the ever evolving capabilities of the iph herald a future of personally tailored care that fundamentally alters the healthcare landscape to place the patient at the center and in control in the past individuals were treated based on approaches thought to be best for groups of patients now we begin the iph epoch of patient centric care designed to continuously improve the health of the individual within their community even as new knowledge accrues whereby rights incentives transparency and control remain the purview of the patient goldstein added iph is an ecosystem for collaboration across disciplines that comprises seven areas smart statistics machine learning artificial intelligence designs software to integrate and analyze health records molecular data and observations the unit is led by daniel gillen professor and chair of statistics and zhaoxia yu associate professor of statistics a2ir applied artificial intelligence research designs practical solutions to real world clinical problems for cost effective value based care it is led by dr peter chang assistant professor of radiological sciences a3 applied analytics and artificial intelligence brings solutions to inpatient ambulatory and community settings and supports pilot applications the area is led by dr daniel chow assistant professor of radiological sciences precision omics generates analyzes and applies genomic proteomic and chemical data it is led by suzanne sandmeyer professor of biological chemistry and leslie thompson donald bren professor of psychiatry human behavior and neurobiology behavior collaboratory for health and wellness powered by syntropy houses the dynamic analytics platforms and patient controlled data at the core of the iph ecosystem the group is led by tom andriola vice chancellor for information technology and data and kai zheng professor of informatics deployable health equity employs machine learning artificial intelligence into communities to create solutions narrowing the disparities gap in the health and well being of vulnerable populations the unit is led by dr dan cooper professor of pediatrics and associate vice chancellor for clinical translational research and bernadette boden albala professor and director of the program in public health and founding dean of the planned school of population public health education and training with leadership from each area brings courses seminars certificates and degrees in statistics machine learning artificial intelligence omics and bioinformatics to practitioners and students because the disciplines included in iph already existed at uci goldstein noted it was in many ways only a small step to join them together and build a resource across campus the synergy created however is no small matter this is the giant leap for healthcare it s glaringly clear that precision health is how to increase the quality of care to decrease the cost of care by both improving how it s delivered and matching cost to value and to deliver quality healthcare to the underserved he said adding that the institute s success will be measured by improvements in individual and community health a major goal is revealing new approaches to tackle ailments that lack successful therapies for many diseases especially neurodegenerative ones like alzheimer s parkinson s and even huntington s where the causal gene is known there are simply no treatments available that change their course we re excited because we know that with precision health we have the potential to define diseases better understand them better and treat them far better said thompson iph co director we expect major breakthroughs while the vision idea for iph has long been in the works the covid 19 pandemic was a beta test demonstrating how rapidly critical medical needs could be addressed in early 2020 with elements of iph in place uci clinicians biomedical and computer scientists and public health experts joined forces to create an ai driven tool to assess the critical care needs of covid patients this app based tool the covid vulnerability index demonstrated that a data driven approach coupled with world class clinical therapeutics could help yield the best outcomes for individuals we couldn t have had a proof of concept with higher stakes than the pandemic said tom andriola iph co director we saw in real time how mobilizing our capabilities to analyze health data and make customized decisions could complement leading edge clinical treatments to save lives and reduce hospital stays additionally there is an explosion of data in healthcare and we re still only using a small fraction in decision making he added iph is including not only data from traditional healthcare settings but also the data coming from a new generation of empowered health consumers who are tracking and managing their own health journey the plan is for iph to have a brick and mortar home on the uci campus that will serve as a hub for educating data informed clinicians to practice at the top of their licenses a site for the infrastructure to facilitate translational research a place for community outreach and a venue for commercial collaborations already industry leaders such as syntropy and mitre and community partners such as children s health of orange county and the va long beach healthcare system are working with iph to leverage uci s capabilities and commitment as a fair broker for health data placing individuals first for patients the message is that uci s institute for precision health is the future of your care and well being goldstein said for the research community iph is a wide open opportunity for discoveries that matter for the business community iph is ready to partner to advance new cost effective care and for the philanthropic community the folks

on learning representations iclr 2022 a globally renowned conference on cutting edge research in deep learning their first paper advances solutions to a fundamental problem in information theory while the second introduces a new model for general purpose lossless data compression understanding compression feasibilityin towards empirical sandwich bounds on the rate distortion function mandt and his ph d student yibo yang quantify the fundamental hardness of compressing real world data such as images if you ve ever paid attention to the file size of jpeg images you may notice how certain kinds of images take up more storage than others of the same dimensions explains yang it turns out that with information theory we can quantify the inherent compressibility of a given type of data using a quantity called the rate distortion function and no data compression algorithm can beat the theoretical performance limit implied by it therefore knowing the rate distortion function of the data being compressed can really help researchers assess and improve their compression algorithms although the rate distortion function can be worked out mathematically for a few simple data distributions establishing it for other data in general especially for big data of practical interest has been an open research problem with this work yang and mandt move closer to this goal by developing a machine learning algorithm that can estimate the rate distortion function of potentially high dimensional types of data such as images and voice recordings it was really exciting to see the algorithm i sketched out on paper actually work on real world data ranging from natural images and speech spectrograms to data from particle physics says yang such data would have posed an insurmountable computation challenge to the previously known method an algorithm from the 1970s still the general problem is not quite solved and i hope this work opens up new possibilities for future research toward lossless compression with machine learningin hbo s television series silicon valley a group of hackers develops a fundamentally new lossless compression algorithm it turns out that fiction is not too far from reality in a recent collaboration involving anji liu a ph d student at ucla and liu s advisor computer science professor guy van den broeck mandt contributed to a new general purpose compression approach lossless compression with probabilistic circuits published as a spotlight at iclr 2022 the idea of lossless compression is very similar to that of morse code where we abbreviate frequent letters like e by a single dit and rare letters by three dits this leads to an optimally short representation of the message says mandt the key to lossless compression is hence to reliably predict how frequently any given symbol occurs for simple data we can just count but for more complicated data like images we need predictive machine learning models while most neural compression employs popular deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks the present work uses a fundamentally different niche machine learning approach called probabilistic circuits pcs with the help of these models the researchers could dramatically accelerate relevant computations that play a key role in data compression as a result their pc based de compression algorithm runs 5 20 times faster than neural compression algorithms that achieve similar bitrates this work says mandt is a great example of how curiosity driven fundamental research can culminate in surprising unforeseeable applications that would never have been discovered otherwise shani murray uci news uci researchers receive state funding to study pandemic forecasting uci news uci s graduate programs

researchers had developed a hybrid human machine framework for ai systems that can complement human expertise from chatbots that answer tax questions to algorithms that drive autonomous vehicles and dish out medical diagnoses artificial intelligence undergirds many aspects of daily life creating smarter more accurate systems requires a hybrid human machine approach according to researchers at the university of california irvine in a study published this month in proceedings of the national academy of sciences they present a new mathematical model that can improve performance by combining human and algorithmic predictions and confidence scores the seeds for this cutting edge work by researchers in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics and the school of social sciences were first planted decades ago this collaboration started with padhraic smyth chancellor s professor in the computer science and statistics departments and mark steyvers a professor in the department of cognitive sciences padhraic smyth left and mark steyvers stand outside of donald bren hall steve zylius uci one of the really nice things about uci is that there s a lot of interdisciplinary activity says smyth whose research is supported through a qualcomm faculty award there is this culture of collaboration so cognitive scientists come to bren hall to attend our ai and machine learning talks and we go to their talks in fact smyth and steyvers have been meeting periodically since the early 2000s we d chat over coffee about our projects says smyth we speak different languages but we re both interested in intelligence just from different perspectives computer science emphasizes artificial and cognitive sciences emphasizes natural and there s a lot of overlap so when the national science foundation nsf put out a call for research related to how humans and ai work together smyth and steyvers put together two proposals both of which were funded in 2019 one grant focuses on hybrid human algorithm predictions exploring how to balance effort accuracy and perceived autonomy the other grant is an assessment of machine learning algorithms in the wild this work led to the recently published pnas paper bayesian modeling of human ai complementarity as announced by uci the paper was co authored by steyvers and smyth along with heliodoro tejeda a graduate student in cognitive sciences and gavin kerrigan a ph d student in computer science funded by the hpi research center at uci the grants have led to other papers co authored by steyvers and smyth as well they worked with kerrigan on combining human predictions with model probabilities via confusion matrices and calibration a paper appearing in proceedings for the thirty fifth conference on neural information processing systems neurips 2021 and they worked with computer science ph d students disi ji and robby logan on active bayesian assessment of blackbox classifiers a paper appearing in proceedings for the thirty fifth aaai conference on artificial intelligence this line of work is part of a larger collaboration with about five or six ph d students says smyth markelle kelly one of those students is markelle kelly a computer science graduate student who last summer received a fellowship through uci s steckler center for responsible ethical and accessible technology create this year kelly was awarded a fellowship through the irvine initiative in ai law and society both the center and initiative are helping facilitate this interdisciplinary work the human machine collaboration between the cognitive sciences and computer science departments explores questions about how people and machines can work together as a team says kelly who is currently investigating how humans and ai can understand the strengths and weaknesses of each other to better delegate tasks by working alongside cognitive science researchers i can better understand theories about the human side of this problem and incorporate these ideas into potential solutions the resulting cross disciplinary experiments and findings are founded on a much more nuanced perspective than if only machine learning experts were involved smyth agrees computer science historically has been a little bit averse to getting humans in the loop but i think ai and machine learning researchers now realize that although our algorithms have been developed and tested in our labs for a decade or two without attracting much attention they are now being widely applied to address real problems involving real people he says as a consequence getting students early in their career involved in these kinds of interesting projects and in discussions related to how ai is being used will help ensure ai is used

why the healthcare industry is a field that can constantly evolve to support the ever changing needs of patients one of these technologies is data science which ty shao believes can spur beneficial discoveries and change in healthcare shao is a graduate student and program ambassador of uci s master of data science program and plans to utilize her data science education in healthcare because the medical field is really close to her heart my dad passed away from advanced kidney cancer when i was young when he initially started feeling discomfort doctors did not immediately suspect that it was cancer since he was a relatively healthy man so by the time he was officially diagnosed it was already too late as he had entered the later stages of cancer says shao this experience is what motivates shao to spend her time in the mds program and beyond participating in cancer research to impact and revolutionize the healthcare industry i intend to use the tools of data science to help expedite life saving diagnoses to cancer patients and improve overall patient care says shao i am interested in working on cancer research throughout my career as a data scientist so that i can help other families who are also afflicted by this disease her passion and interests in the medical field extend beyond her research and professional goals as well i also enjoy exercising and working out because i think it s incredibly important to be active and to maintain a healthy lifestyle the experiences i ve had throughout my life encouraged me to prioritize and value my physical health says shao before joining the mds program shao turned her love for math into an academic pursuit at the university of california riverside she majored in statistics because it s a discipline that has many real world applications and in her undergraduate studies shao learned about the field of data science shao knew uci would be the perfect school for furthering her interests in this industry being one of the few professional programs in the uc system that offered a graduate degree solely in the field of data science uci easily became my top choice for the school where i wanted to conduct my graduate studies shao says i always had an affinity toward the uc system having grown up in southern california since it is both close to home and offers a great educational experience shao enjoys her experience in the mds program she says the coursework taught by her professors is enriching and beneficial to her development as a data scientist she also loves learning alongside her peers i have also enjoyed meeting and bonding with the classmates in my cohort who also share my passion for data science she says from this program i am hoping to gain the necessary skills and connections that will be deeply integrated into my career in addition to achieving her professional goals in the mds program shao hopes to leverage her ambassadorship position to encourage women to pursue studies and careers in the data science field she says that in her experience as a woman studying statistics she is part of a minority group and her male classmates often overshadow her to shao it s important that more women enter data science and other stem fields and bring in unique perspectives that do not exist in male dominated spaces women have so much to offer to the industry and can provide additional perspectives and approaches to problems that are not considered by their male peers says shao as an ambassador for the mds program i am hoping to provide women with more exposure to the field of data science and to encourage them to also become involved in the development and advancement of this discipline with a number of ambitions and commitments life can be stressful so shao shared some activities she likes to do to de stress and have fun with her family and friends outside of school i enjoy cooking and baking as these are activities i find to be extremely therapeutic and rewarding says shao food is something that connects all types of people and brings different cultures together i love showing my appreciation towards my close friends and family members by making meals or baking delicious treats for them as the spring quarter begins that also means shao s first year in the mds program nears its end and her second year will begin soon shao wants to make the most of her education by gaining professional working experience and applying what she has learned to a practical real world setting from there i am hoping to acquire enough experience and knowledge so that i am eventually able to make significant contributions to cancer research she says i would like to establish my career as a data scientist in the healthcare field as it is one that i am immensely passionate about

county and other organizations develop grant proposals calculate sample sizes interpret data and design research databases in the deforest park neighborhood of north long beach however the wife and mother of two young children is better known as a community advocate she was recently recognized by assembly member mike gipson as the 2021 woman of the year and she has long helped local residents stay engaged and empowered over the years she has served on the north long beach neighborhood alliance uptown property and business improvement district pbid and citizens police complaint commission cpcc and she is currently chair of the long beach planning commission tackling complex issues such as affordable housing now as ricks oddie campaigns for long beach city council in district 9 her

homelessness economic development and small business recovery public health parks and open spaces diversity equity and inclusion and public safety assembly member mike gipson named dr joni ricks oddie shown here with her husband and two children 2021 woman of the year for california assembly district 64 professional and personal perspectivespublic health is one area in particular that spotlights the interconnected nature of ricks oddie s professional and personal experiences part of my campaign revolves around public health outreach to minority communities and marginalized communities says ricks oddie i want to lead conversations around health equity and funding of public health programs at the city level the pandemic has really highlighted the need for more structural funding for our health department and with my background in statistics and epidemiology i want to bring a more data driven lens to how we make decisions yet ricks oddie isn t only about the numbers as highlighted in a march 7 facebook post about the birth of her daughter chloe the issue of health equity is also personal for her in the post she recounts how she gave birth to her second child in a car outside the hospital after having been sent home two hours earlier a situation that likely led to life threatening medical complications that left ricks oddie in need of surgery a few weeks later as a black woman i m acutely aware that black babies face a higher than normal infant mortality rate and that black mothers face a higher than normal mortality rate after birth these differences are rooted in the burden that black mothers face due to systematic racial bias she posted as a researcher and academic i deal with data and statistics every day on that day my daughter could easily have become a statistic in the worst possible way in chloe s honor this women s history month i d like to bring greater awareness and respect to those mothers particularly black mothers who literally risk their lives to give birth wrote ricks oddie in a facebook post for her daughter s first birthday ricks oddie goes on to say that this experience was part of her motivation to run for city council one of the reasons i m running for city council is to bring my professional and personal perspective on women s health health equity public health and community health to my work on behalf of our city she is sharing her story to build awareness and to bring a name and a voice to some of the complex challenges facing the city and to encourage others to share their stories as well she credits the black infant health program in long beach with providing her a safe space to process her experience thinking about our healthcare system in totality insurance access care representation and the issues around implicit bias is difficult because these are all things you can t necessarily prove because there are so many dynamics was race a contributing factor these are hard conversations but they re conversations that need to happen data driven solutionsat the same time ricks oddie wants to ensure that any policy changes introduced are not only supported by the data but also tracked and evaluated to properly evaluate programs in the city we need to attach appropriate metrics to assess whether changes made are even working she says i want to advocate for the creation of an office of data and evaluation which would help city departments and staff figure out what data is out there to support a particular position or program change ricks oddie s unique skill set would allow her to help identify appropriate milestones and metrics for policies and then effectively package and visualize them for presentations to the city council and other strategic partners in the city and this approach could be applied to everything from healthcare to homelessness for example she knows from her work with various organizations that it takes an average of 17 touches to persuade someone who is homeless to agree to accept help a lot of community members get frustrated when nothing happens after they make just one call but people have rights you have to develop trust with people and that takes time and resources gathering and understanding the data helps quantify the time and resources needed while also providing important context for continued community engagement from a policy standpoint we really have to think about what resources we provide our health department our social services department and our police department she says because when people call about issues around loitering somebody camping on public property or issues around mental health all of that connects a lot of city departments she stresses the need to manage these different entities at a holistic level while also educating the public about the role they play in helping to address various issues ready to hit the ground runningof the nine neighborhood associations in district 9 ricks oddie has been endorsed by eight association presidents i ve worked with them for the last decade so they trust my opinion and know that i ll be somebody who will always have an open door policy with them and a listening ear she has also been endorsed by both the previous councilmember and by current councilmember rex richardson who is running for mayor they also know that i m somebody who will fiercely advocate for our community i already have a lot of relationships going in which will allow me to hit the ground running she says and while her professional background brings a high level of analytical skills and expertise to the table it s her ability to apply those skills in support policies that will actually improve people s daily lives that matters i tell people i m raising my family here and i want them to live in a community that they re proud of where it feels like their city and their city leaders care about their well being shani murray applications open for new uci summer biostatistics

will be offering a two week session titled data data analytics theory applications from july 25 to aug 5 high school students will be on campus monday through friday from 9 a m to 4 p m exploring the foundations of data science with real world hands on projects computer science is more than just programming the whole idea behind the summer academy is to offer a selection of courses to help high school students explore the various areas and topics that comprise the ever changing and growing field of computing explains computer science professor magda el zarki the director of the academy leading this effort we re starting off with this one course on data analytics it is a great way to launch the program given the tremendous interest that students have in data it s the big thing these days camp attendees will spend their days in the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci learning about data science methods and concepts through hands on projects using anonymized health data from actual patients the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci mornings will start with lessons from professor babak shahbaba of uci s department of statistics or from professor sam behseta of cal state fullerton s department of mathematics they will be teaching students how to collect process summarize and visualize data after a daily lunch break highly qualified and trained uci graduate and undergraduate students will lead small teams working on projects related to actual datasets often drawn for biological and medical sciences the teams will make predictions using statistical models test scientific hypotheses using statistical inference techniques and make decisions under uncertainty by applying statistical thinking for the students it will be exciting to work with actual datasets and see what it s like to make sense from databases comprising a jumble of numbers and more says el zarki students will learn how to manipulate the data make the models analyze their results and present it in a way that illustrates certain interesting conclusions it will be an eye opener for a lot of kids students will also get to tour the campus visit research labs in the school s departments of computer science informatics and statistics and explore career pathways in the many related fields of computing interested students must apply online by may 6 2022 the application is short but does require the name title and email address of a teacher principal or school administrator who when contacted can submit a letter of recommendation also by the may 6 deadline there is no application fee and the 2 500 program cost covers lunches snacks and all materials required ics will provide laptops with all the software needed for the course the first cohort will likely be around 30 students the plan is for the ics summer academy to grow in offerings and cohort size the goal for next year is to offer three or four courses eventually building up to around six to eight courses by 2025 serving up to 250 students each year i m very positive about this effort for the future because i think it s very different from anything else out there says el zarki we already have faculty really interested in covering other areas the focus of future sessions might include security game development the internet of things iot ai and machine learning quantum computing and more there might also be more advanced sessions on certain topics for those interested in learning more about a particular field the goal of the summer academy is to help students explore and get a better understanding of what it means to be a computer scientist and the exciting careers that one can pursue being one says el zarki we want to give them a good sense of the diversity and vastness of the field of computing all the areas of expertise and knowledge that it encompasses and that make it so exciting shani murray dr joni ricks oddie applies data driven lens

discussing everything from chocolate milk to dating apps and referencing shows like parks and recreation and rupaul s drag race an open access book co authored by mine dogucu removes barriers to learning bayesian statistics and finds new ways to engage readers i sincerely believe that a generation of students will cite this book as inspiration for their use of and love for bayesian statistics says duke university professor yue jiang in his review of bayes rules an introduction to applied bayesian modeling crc press 2022 this is perhaps the most engaging introductory statistics textbook i have ever read that was the goal when mine dogucu an assistant professor of teaching in uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics started collaborating with alicia a johnson and miles q ott on their bayes rules book which is freely available online or can be purchased from crc press as a hard copy paperback or e book a preprint by the authors outlines their commitment to accessibility and inclusivity while writing the book we wanted to make bayesian statistics more accessible for undergraduate students everywhere particularly novice learners says dogucu and for diverse groups of learners from different backgrounds to accomplish this they deliberately included a wide variety of entertaining examples and exercises as joseph k blitzstein of harvard university notes in his foreword you will encounter a vibrant sample of applications in this book ranging from weather prediction to lgbtq anti discrimination laws and from who calls soda pop or calls pop soda to how to classify penguin species most importantly careful study of this book will empower you to conduct thoughtful bayesian analyses for the data and applications you care about not surprisingly dogucu herself first became passionate about statistics after seeing its real world use in an application area she cared about what first sparked your interest in statistics i was a math major in a small liberal arts college statistics back then was not as popular especially for the small school and there was no statistics department per se it was within the math department i decided to take a statistics class and i remember very well the moment i decided i wanted to study more statistics we were working on a dataset about hurricane katrina about housing losses and damages and i was so impressed i thought wow we can actually use math to answer useful questions of course useful means something different for everyone but for me it means helping people so using statistics to understand problems impacting people was so fascinating to me and that s when i decided i needed to take more steps to study this why is there now a need for books on bayesian statistics targeted at the undergraduate level bayesian statistics itself is not new but traditionally it has not been taught widely there are many reasons for this one reason is that it is computationally challenging second in the past there were more criticisms surrounding the subjectivity of bayesian methods it s becoming more popular because we now have greater computing power and the scientific community or part of the community has reevaluated subjectivity more schools are offering a bayesian course now another reason is that there are two big paradigms in statistics one is frequentist and the other is bayesian so if we don t teach bayesian we are not really giving our students the full picture of different approaches to statistical analysis also there s this key value that is almost always reported in scientific studies the benchmark p less than 0 05 the p value is overused and often misused in studies experts argue that when writing a whole scientific study it shouldn t all come down to just the p value and one of the suggestions in the field of statistics is to make more room for bayesian methods the american statistical association put out a statement on p values and it starts with a quote about why colleges teach p 0 05 we teach it because it s what we do we do it because it s what we teach so if we actually teach bayesian methods that s one way to help break that cycle it brings an additional perspective to statistical analyses beyond the p value we have to prepare our students for that how is uci s department of statistics preparing students i recently co authored a preprint on the current state of undergraduate bayesian education and we were looking at courses across the nation in the highest ranked 100 universities and 50 liberal arts colleges we found 46 institutions that offer a bayesian course but most of these were elective courses only four institutions required bayesian statistics and uci is very special because we were one of them we offer an undergraduate course every winter stats 115 introduction to bayesian data analysis and it s a required course for our data science program so it s not surprising that this course is accessible at the undergraduate level at uci we have many famous bayesians in our department including hal stern wes johnson michele guindani veronica berrocal and babak shahbaba so ics is just a good bayesian place and we re also collaborating with other schools for example as part of a recent nsf grant cal state fullerton will start offering a new course like ours you wanted readers to find people like themselves in the book how did you achieve that goal so we assume that our readers will have diverse backgrounds because we started with our own students and our own students have diverse backgrounds but at the same time we aimed for this book to be accessible to everyone you don t necessarily have to be an undergraduate student we wanted it to be relevant to different cultures for instance there s an example taken from u s elections with presidential candidates going through primaries although other political systems might have primaries it s not universal so to use that example we had to give the context so we tried really hard to read the book from different perspectives to make it as accessible as possible to a diverse group of learners from different backgrounds what is one of your favorite examples from the book one part of the book that i really like is the statistical model evaluation and the reason for that is because at least in the books i used to read as a student myself model evaluation mostly focused on statistical numbers for example some model evaluation criteria that we would calculate but in our book in addition to that we also focus on ethical aspects of statistical models like is the model biased how were the data collected how could the model impact individuals or society at large i really like that this is included in the book how do you think the field of statistics might change based on greater diversity and inclusion this book is not the only thing that s going to make our field more diverse i think it might create small changes like a reader might see one example in the book that they connect to or an instructor might be inspired to make their materials more accessible but these are all small water drops in the bucket of course our aspiration is to have a bigger impact on the field but that usually comes from institutional changes like providing access to more opportunities for students in addition to affordability you also made the content accessible for people with visual disabilities yes we made sure to use color blind friendly color palettes in addition the online version of the book supports alternate text that is image descriptions read by screen readers alternate text not only makes images accessible to the blind and visually impaired but also to everyone because for instance they show up in internet searches to the best of my knowledge bayes rules is the first statistics e textbook that supports alternate text and you were deliberate in whom you cited in the book and how you cited them why unfortunately the way citations work is that usually we cite people who are already cited a lot we don t go out of our way at least i didn t before writing this book to pay attention to why i was citing someone so in preparation of the book we tried to read more authors from diverse groups to make sure we were including different points of view and that s not just for the book but to benefit us as educators by reading more then we wanted to make sure the book captured all those different scholars we also paid close attention to citing trans authors correctly actually my first quarter here at uci i cited an article on transgender scholars in my blog on inclusivity before even realizing tess informatics professor theresa tanenbaum was here in my school but basically we tried really hard to check their websites so we didn t just rely on how other people cited them finally what informed your decision to make the book open access this was of course a mutual decision with my co authors and their reasons might be similar or different but from my perspective textbooks are unaffordable as a student i was on a textbook scholarship from my school so i could buy books through that luckily here at uci we even have students who have food insecurity i wouldn t want to say to them don t buy food buy my own book especially considering that students actually contributed to the book maybe not by writing it but i ve been basically using some drafts of it for three years my students found typos and helped me see what examples were most effective and i learned from their responses to the material so they were actually part of the writing process which makes it unreasonable to ask them to pay for it i don t know the exact numbers but hundreds of people are accessing the online book on a daily basis from many different countries so it s been a great decision if students cannot access the book they cannot learn from it so accessibility was our number one goal i don t think a print book would have reached as many readers shani

california r users group socal rug a local forum of people who use the statistical programming language r bella feng sep dadsetan and john preach were the featured panelists along with ryan benz the three of them shared their experiences working in the data science industry focusing on their career development over the years career growth bella feng the first question of the night was how one can stand out at work and form positive relationships with their colleagues bella feng head of statistical programming and clinical trial data science at biotechnology company eqrx started the discussion by encouraging everyone to be engaged and open minded feng mentioned that she got her first job because of a presentation she did at a statistical analysis system sas conference to feng it s important to build strong relationships with those around you because they can pay off in the long run in your career sep dadsetan sep dadsetan who is the executive director of real world evidence analytics at healthcare and artificial intelligence company concertai agreed with feng and emphasized the significance of knowing the structure of your company and how you interact with your colleagues to understand the impact of your role it s really important to send an email introduce yourself and try to connect with others and see what they re working on dadsetan said i think through that you ll see where you can contribute and how the company is organized john peach in addition to networking john peach principal data scientist at cloud technology company oracle and member of socal rug says using data to inform decisions and be customer focused while keeping the company vision in mind can improve your work performance and relationships with your clients for data scientists one of the big parts of the job is to be a trusted adviser your job is to help the people that make decisions make the decision that s based around what the data is telling them as opposed to what their gut says peach said make sure that what you re going to do has some real impact along the way and you should be able to identify everything that you re doing and what the impact is going to be like for the customer biotechnology company seer s director of data science and socal rug member ryan benz led the latter half of the panel s discussion on career growth with a lighting round to discuss career growth and pitfalls ryan benz benz and the panelists noted that being curious dependable and a problem solver and having people skills are signs that an employee may be ready to be promoted when asked to share some examples of what might set back professionally they said being indecisive and having a limited or negative mindset may hurt you to avoid stumbling in your career peach re emphasized looking at the bigger picture and advised performing at the level you want to be promoted to and taking ownership of your work management vs individual contributor career tracksthe panel discussion shifted to focus on two career tracks being a manager versus being an individual contributor peach described one of the differences between being a manager and an individual contributor being the scope and type of their responsibilities while individual contributors manage themselves and are responsible for their projects a manager s role entails managing people such as overseeing personnel and creating teams in that sense being a manager is almost like being a parent according to feng dadseten added that good managers understand the scope of their own knowledge and skills and will help you find the support you need if they cannot personally provide certain resources the panelists then discussed how one knows if being a manager or an individual contributor is the right role for them understanding how you want to manage your impact at work is one thing to consider to give an example peach noted that being a technical leader allows you to have an impact throughout your organization but your impact is still focused on your area of expertise on the other hand a manager will have a broader impact on both projects and the people they re guiding as you re going up the ic individual contributor track ask yourself if you are enjoying the project management aspects more than you re enjoying the technical hands on work peach said that s a good indication that maybe taking on some management role would be interesting to you being a manager also gives you more influence in the workplace which is one of the things feng enjoys i really like the influence part said feng adding that she championed the use of r in a previous role but was unsuccessful because she was not a decision maker so once there was a reorganization my initiative was killed because everything was outsourced but right now i m not an individual contributor and more like the decision maker so i can decide dadsetan said that as you progress in your career it s good to take note of what you like and dislike and what you re good at and not good at because these are all factors that come into play when deciding what role you find best fits you i think it s important to realize that it s not a decision you have to make now and can never go back to ever dadsetan said there s relatively fluidity balancing personal professional lifecareer advancement inevitably comes with more expectations and responsibilities that can even interfere with your personal life benz said that managing stress and experiencing burnout are not talked about enough even in school so the panel discussion ended with everyone sharing how they handle the demands of their careers dadsetan acknowledged that you might hit the ground running straight out of college but it s imperative you don t overwork yourself and start drawing lines as needed as an individual you have to balance being fresh out of school wanting to make a good impression wanting to do your best so that might require you to work overtime dadsetan said but it s also really important to be listening to your body and know what it is that you want to prioritize in your life and take stock of what matters to you setting boundaries at work is also a way that feng maintains a healthy work life balance in the past she juggled a number of roles and responsibilities all at once at work causing her to burn out feng said attending a weeklong retreat and connecting with herself without electronics helped her recover and be more in tune with her body another way to prevent burnout is by learning to separate your personal and professional life it s a job it s not my identity peach said for a very long time my self identity was tied to what i was doing making that separation has helped a lot it can also help to find purpose in your career so that you are moving up learning new things and specializing rather than being stuck doing the same tasks or trying to do everything at once i personally am much better if i know that i m having personal growth i m learning a lot peach said focus on where your talents are as you go up in your career you re going to be more and more specialized in what you re known for so focus on doing that as opposed to doing everything karen phan don t think you can learn bayesian statistics think again with bayes rules qu elected international statistical institute member quick links news archive

expo held in the new state of the art interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb the event was a culmination of months of hard work offering the students the opportunity to present projects completed for undergraduate capstone courses in informatics computer science and data science as well as for the butterworth product development competition project sponsors and students alike look forward to this annual opportunity to highlight projects they ve labored over throughout the year students presenting their work in the iseb lobby at the ics project expo partnering with industry the expo really ties together the four foundational elements of engagement that our programs offer project experience entrepreneurship mentorship and opportunities for internship says jason king senior associate director of corporate relations in ics the expo benefits project sponsors looking to recruit and showcases all the great work of our students these ics undergraduates spent anywhere from 10 to 20 weeks experiencing hands on learning working on real world projects collaborating with industry partners peter colligan a senior technology executive for the sap s 4hana industry cloud was one of 40 industry professionals in attendance at the expo speaking of sap s goal of helping to accelerate collaboration between academia startups and industry colligan stresses the importance of these types of events i get a chance to directly and informally interact with student teams and talk about the engineering skills and projects they care about those discussions can sometimes go deeper where professors themselves step in and get a chance to highlight and validate ideas and common challenges with industry practitioners he continues very realistic and concrete outcomes have come out of this such as ideas for future capstone projects full time employment work or joint industry research initiatives jason king thanks the corporate partners gaining real world experiencerecognizing the tremendous benefits of providing opportunities for practical application and industry engagement the department of informatics has been offering a capstone course for more than a dozen years it is now a graduation requirement for informatics and ics has also added elective undergraduate capstone courses for computer science and data science majors presenting your work professionally in a conference like event is a very valuable experience for our undergraduate students says computer science professor sergio gago masague who launched the computer science capstone course in 2020 i personally enjoyed watching students and sponsors engaging in very interesting discussions about projects and ideas for future work one of the top computer science capstone projects leveraged artificial intelligence to create a personalized recommendation system for quick service restaurants qsrs for the ai driven personalized menu content for the qsr drive thu project students ezra hammond rieko konishi arian namavar and ryan sakuma partnered with delphi display systems they developed a machine learning system that presents relevant items to users based on their preferences and dietary restrictions to improve the drive thru experience they also presented their project and competed at the national capstone design conference in dallas texas on june 6 2022 the capstone project gave me the confidence that after my four years of education under the school of ics i am ready to tackle new and unfamiliar projects successfully and implement what i ve learned says namavar who graduated in june during the interviews i had with various companies i would always answer their questions with my experience with our ics capstone sponsor and project in mind which i think helped me secure an offer namavar will be working as a software developer at nisum the ics expo was also a great opportunity to present our project and take ownership of our result seeing the progress other students made was another aspect that made me proud of ics informatics lecturer darren denenberg was similarly impressed by the students progress noting that everyone was able to achieve something

it was a project i thought no one would be interested in and it ended up being one of the best groups best projects and they also went to dallas to compete in the national capstone conference professor denenberg left and ics dean marios right listen to students pitch their products informatics professor hadar ziv attended the conference with the audioscribe team and says they represented themselves and the school of ics very well they really held their own conducting multiple high quality presentations and enjoying their interactions with their peers and with capstone instructors from around the country however even students who don t have space in their schedule for a capstone course or conference or who aren t upperclassmen have opportunities for entrepreneurship thanks to the butterworth competition this product development competition is designed to encourage the creation of new technologies with the potential for commercialization this year s winning project leprendo was on display at the ics project expo letting participants view the online farmer s marketplace created by computer science major dylan riffle computer science and engineering major kanu chandra business administration major dan ta and psychological sciences major nina nguyen by developing our pitch deck and going through the competition we learned the importance of being able to combine the technical development of a product with business development and communicate this effectively says riffle the team will continue to develop leprendo over the summer we re firing on all cylinders and increasingly promoting the value of capstone projects showing why regional and national companies should be involved with these programs and the talent pipelines they offer says king our programs are

minor in statistics current course listings news seminars news seminar center for statistical consulting conference experience confirms competitive edge of ics capstone program july 25 2022 what are some of the benefits of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics aside from the fact that it s the only computing focused school in the uc system and happens to sit in the middle of silicon beach it also offers capstone courses that provide hands on experience in a practical real world environment the strength and importance of such programs was reiterated june 6 8 2022 when ics faculty students and staff attended the national capstone design conference in dallas texas i came away from the capstone design conference even more convinced that providing hands on practical experience is essential to prepare our students for life after college says informatics lecturer matthew bietz during his projects in human computer interaction capstone course students take all of the skills they have learned in ics classrooms and put them together in the context of a software development project these projects require students to balance real world priorities deadlines and resource constraints they have to understand client needs and figure out how to best meet them given their team s strengths and weaknesses he explains our capstone program gives our students a real competitive edge in the job market this year some of the top students from the ics undergraduate capstone program with course offerings for informatics computer science and data science majors traveled to dallas to present their projects at the same time ics faculty and staff learned about and shared best practices uci students taking a break from the conference to explore plano texas sharing best practicesone goal of the biennial capstone design conference is to provide a forum for sharing ideas it features sessions focused on how to engage industry partners bring in dollars for philanthropic support manage courses and so on the conference gave us the chance to find out what is working and not working at other schools learn about tools and techniques for organizing and teaching capstone courses and network with colleagues says bietz it also gave him the opportunity to share some best practices from ics collaborating with informatics professor hadar ziv who has been leading capstone courses in ics since 2009 bietz co authored a paper for the conference on empowering capstone students in client interactions they point out in the paper that most student training has been in classroom settings where the structure of tasks is well defined the expectations are clear and the instructor is an absolute authority they argue that a critical lesson gained from the capstone experience is learning how to have a productive disagreement with a client ziv also co authored a paper with colleagues from texas a m and from brazil on adapting scrum ceremonies in undergraduate capstone projects the paper talks about getting student teams to follow agile values and principles and scrum activities and best practices while acknowledging important differences between a scrum team in the real world and undergraduate students in a capstone course these were just two of the more than 30 papers and posters presented at the conference ziv also presented two workshop sessions in collaboration with uci alumnus david ochi director of the beall student design and butterworth product development competitions the workshops covered how to generate ideas and how to translate projects into startups ics had a strong showing at the conference not just by the number of papers posters workshops and other activities but also by a strong attendance and active engagement with all other attendees says ziv our presence was well noticed and well received jason king senior associate director of corporate relations in ics agreed noting that it was a win win situation we attended this conference hoping to take away some golden nuggets or gems learning from other institutions he compared it to being an athlete seeking out better competition during training if you truly want to grow and be the best soccer player you need to get outside of your region to compete against other players to raise that bar and this is a perfect example of that he explains this is the first time we ve gone outside of our region and it s only helping us grow now we re opening up those communication channels and people respect our feedback and vice versa presenting projects and networkingwhile half of the conference focused on best practices the other half focused on student engagement with students competing presenting and networking with their peers and also meeting with high school students interested in computer science and engineering our students who attended the conference were amazing says bietz presenting their projects in a competitive poster session was a great learning experience and they got great feedback from the judges and other attendees the conference also provided an opportunity for them to network with students from other schools meet representatives of tech companies and strengthen their bond with each other connecting with other students was a highlight for jessie chang a business information management major who presented her team s project canvas tools for teachers the tools she helped design aim to alleviate common challenges in the existing education model i enjoyed meeting new people the most there were so many different teams from different parts of the countries she says it was just really cool meeting them and learning about their projects she added that she learned a lot about engineering the conference seems more geared toward engineering students so it was a surprise to all of us that our projects were even accepted as it was all software king noted that the conference is making an effort to incorporate more computer science students and projects into its biennial event the capstone conference in dallas was a fantastic opportunity to showcase two quarters of hard work as well as engage with students and professors from all over the united states says software engineering major ellen kulla who presented the audioscribe cough diarization project with teammates alexis diaz jinli duan qiantai duan and yuan wang audioscribe developed in a capstone course taught by informatics lecturer darren denenberg analyzes different sounds for use in clinical research and healthcare settings the conference adds kulla really showed us how much students are able to accomplish as a group in a short period of time jason king front right with audioscribe team members another ics project presented was developed by computer science students ezra hammond rieko konishi arian namavar and ryan sakuma the students collaborated with delphi display systems in a capstone course taught by computer science professor sergio gago masague to develop a recommendation system for quick service restaurants qsrs my team had the opportunity to attend the conference and it was an amazing experience getting to represent the school of ics and interact with sponsors companies colleges and universities from all over the u s and canada says namavar their project ai driven personalized menu content for the qsr drive thru uses a machine learning system to present relevant items to users based on their preferences and dietary restrictions cultivating that competitive edge the capstone program is the one of the best things about ics showcasing the great work that s going on within the school from undergraduate students says king the program provides opportunities for internships and professional development helps students learn how to apply technical skills and use various project management and communication tools and lets them practice soft skills and networking in a real world environment we want to make sure we re using best practices when it comes to these offerings and that our program is on par if not better than other standout schools across the nation says king this

from july 11 through august 19 2022 twenty three students from around the u s came to uci for the newly launched irvine summer institute in biostatistics and undergraduate data science isi buds the institute is part of the summer institute in biostatistics program offered through the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid this year uci became only the 10th university in the nation to host this free six week summer training course aimed at addressing the growing need for biostatisticians and data scientists offered through the department of statistics in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics the isi buds program provides not only training in the fundamentals of biostatistics data science and computing but also experience in conducting cutting edge biomedical research the main goal is to excite students about careers and graduate school in biostatistics says statistics professor vladimir minin who co directs the program with ics colleagues dan gillen babak shahbaba and mine dogucu careers in biostatistics are peculiar in the sense that a lot of them require a graduate degree so there s a need for more training in this area explains minin however biostatistics is rarely taught at the undergraduate level so many undergraduate students do not know about career opportunities in this area sarah schlund a senior at uc santa barbara double majoring in statistics and data science and in geography agrees i had been searching for an opportunity to gain experience in biostatistics prior to committing to a five year doctorate program in the field however such opportunities are few and far between she says isi buds offers the rare opportunity to gain biostatistics experience as an undergraduate and learn from the very impressive faculty at uci who have immense biostatistics knowledge and experience both in industry and academic research ics faculty members and the inaugural cohort of students for the irvine summer institute in biostatistics and undergraduate data science an impressive inaugural cohortthe inaugural cohort of students selected from more than 150 applications came from a wide variety of schools including the university of connecticut emory university montana state university the university of arizona university of michigan university of vermont and university of washington there was also a regional presence with students from uci uc riverside uc santa barbara and ucla the highly competitive program includes up to 500 in travel expenses free housing and a meal plan or a 2 500 stipend as well as 600 for incidental expenses the cohort was also a diverse group of students with almost 40 coming from groups that are underrepresented in the quantitative sciences we were able to recruit a significant number of students from historically excluded backgrounds with the hope of increasing diversity in the field of biostatistics says minin that was a very important goal because many are first generation college students who typically lack information about graduate school and about the many career options open to them the program included career preparedness activities including a workshop on the grad school application process and a q a with ph d students and outlined classes that students should take to have a more competitive application making this information available to everyone levels the playing field a little bit explains minin people from pharmaceutical and biotech companies including uci data science graduate jessica george came to talk with students about careers in the biotech industry in addition communications coach bri mcwhorter gave a two hour workshop on how to present scientific information helping prepare students for their research presentations on the final day of the program karren messer who is a professor and chief of the division of biostatistics at the herbert wertheim school of public health at uc san diego gave a talk and offered students valuable feedback on their presentations it was a very impressive group of students says gillen chair of the uci department of statistics they came in and within six weeks they did three weeks of courses both on technical and soft skills and then they jumped right into three weeks of real research pounding out an amazing amount of work and giving wonderful presentations at the end of it real world research a smashing successstudents attending the program started with lectures and labs conducted by six different instructors and a statistics ph d student teaching assistant learning how to design and analyze clinical trials model infectious disease dynamics and analyze big data in genomics transcriptomics and imaging the students came from various backgrounds so we spent the first three weeks making sure they were all on the same page in terms of their technical knowledge says minin we devoted this time to checking off all the boxes of what they needed to know for their research projects students then worked under the supervision of research mentors in addition to statistics professors gillen minin and shahbaba the following also served as mentors louis ehwerhemuepha manager of computational research choc research institute lauren gyllenhammer assistant professor of pediatrics uci daniel parker assistant professor of population health and disease prevention uci elizabeth read assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering uci and pathik wadhwa professor of psychiatry human behavior uci the real heart of the program was the research projects and that was only possible because of the dedication of the biomedical scientists whom we asked to participate says minin it was a smashing success because of their engagement with the students in addition four statistics ph d students provided invaluable support to the teams during the project phase of the institute the research covered the following topics analyzing the impact of maternal stress volatility during pregnancy on child health outcomes predicting maternal stress during pregnancy understanding movement patterns of farmers and forest workers from the thailand myanmar border conducting a spatio temporal analysis of melioidosis cases in lao people s democratic republic uncovering gene gene interaction motifs from single cell transcriptomic data and assessing associations between congenital conditions and covid 19 severity in children i was motivated to apply to this program because i was thrilled to get my hands on some real world biomedical data do collaborative research and learn from world class experts in statistics by means of the uci department of statistics faculty says dante ramirez an undergraduate majoring in statistics and minoring in bioethics at the university of washington what i liked best about the program was the opportunity to collaborate with like minded statisticians in a clinical research setting working with a cohort of statisticians and data scientists with relatively homogeneous skills in this setting and being guided by statistical mentors is such a special opportunity in learning my own strengths and weaknesses how to effectively communicate and work with others and how to do contemporary clinical and quantitative research although ramirez had originally intended to go straight into industry after graduating he has since changed his plans the isi buds program convinced me to apply to a biostatistics or public health graduate school program as this would make my goal of transitioning into a public health regulatory position much more attainable the research groups have some fun after giving their presentations left vladimir minin pink shirt and right dan gillen blue shirt with their student groups exploring so calboth ramirez and schlund were impressed by the research experience gained as well as by the ability to enjoy some downtime and explore southern california i was pleasantly surprised with the culture of the department and how plentiful the weekend activities were says ramirez as they were very conducive of bonding between my cohort and meeting various graduate students schlund agreed the professors also made large efforts to get to know us personally outside of dedicated lecture and research time they planned and attended weekend events that included kayaking whale watching hiking etc she says every professor in the program has been exceptionally personable kind and genuine to every student in the program summer 2023isi buds has secured funding for a minimum of five years so planning for summer 2023 is already underway registration will open in march 2023 and you can visit the application page for more information we want to make sure that we re feeding a diverse pipeline for the stem fields in general but also for biostatistics and statistics says gillen so we re going to continue to grow the program we hope that it becomes a hallmark of the department to be able to attract bright students into the graduate programs not just at uci but for

top 10 jobs in 2022 according to u s news world report the growing popularity of data focused careers has created a demand for students who understand the immense challenges and real world impact of complex data analysis this demand is the backdrop for the socal data science program a collaborative effort between faculty from uci california state university fullerton csuf and cypress college aimed at recruiting training and dispatching a diverse workforce of stem and data science majors led by statistics professors babak shahbaba and mine dogucu of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics and mathematics professor roberto pelayo the program is funded through a national science foundation grant preparing a diverse workforce via academic and industrial partnership with 1 5 million in funding across the three institutes and over the next three years the goal is to recruit 120 fellows from the three campuses offering targeted coursework and hands on training research opportunities and career development workshops the program is off to a strong start with 32 fellows selected from a pool of more than 200 applicants this diverse cohort is 87 women and students from other historically underrepresented backgrounds having such a diverse and strong group of students is amazing says shahbaba that was one of the goals of the program students and faculty of the socal data science program during the winter and spring this first cohort of students took data science courses developed through the socal data science program and offered at uci csuf or cypress college then the students put their new skills to the test with a summer research project rigorous training at summer bootcampprior to starting the six week research project students attended a one week bootcamp at uci the topics covered included exploratory data analysis advanced r programing and generalized linear models we had students coming from different backgrounds and fields computer science statistics biological sciences and we wanted to make sure that before they started doing research they had the required skills says shahbaba the bootcamp brought everyone together in terms of research preparedness the students really helped each other and worked well together the bootcamp also included a session on ethics in data science as well as training in professional and academic development we focused on more than just data science covering resume writing and interview skills says shahbaba and we invited graduate students to talk about their experiences in grad school real world research experienceonce the bootcamp ended students broke into several groups with each group diving into a real world data analysis project it was six weeks of intense research says shahbaba they were on campus at least three days a week from 10 a m to 4 p m working in the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci designed for collaborative research it s such a well designed space for these kind of projects it made our collaboration with the industrial and academic partners very smooth and productive students collaborating in an iseb classroom shahbaba lined up a variety of academic and non academic partners for the summer projects children s hospital of orange county choc the center of hydro meteorology and remote sensing chrs the fleischman lab the fortin lab and the reich lab the program was an amazing experience for me because it really gave me a chance to apply skills i learned from my courses to real world problems says program fellow giles pierre carlos a data science major at uci i was able to apply the techniques i ve learned and build significant models for an extremely interesting area of neuroscience research at the undergraduate research symposium on aug 4 2022 the last day of the summer program carlos and his teammates presented their work on understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of memory their project modeling nonspatial sequence memory task using neural decoding leveraged data provided by dr norbert fortin and the fortin lab at uci the program was collaborative in nature and because of that i learned how to solve statistical problems in a team setting says carlos on top of that the program solidified my interest in obtaining a master s in statistics and even made me open to going for a ph d in the future overall the program made a huge impact on where i want to take my career alyssandrei parinas who is studying computer science at cypress college and worked with carlos on the neuroscience project agreed the entire experience was challenging yet very rewarding she says the program taught me a lot of things and allowed me to better understand what data science is ayah halabi a mathematics major at csuf conducted research on how diet can affect symptoms related to myeloproliferative neoplasms mpn a cancer located within the blood and bone marrow her team s project impact of mediterranean and dash diets on mpn symptoms leveraged data from dr angela fleischman of uci s school of medicine and the fleischman lab this program has taught me so much about the data science world and how important it is to make our lives better wrote halabi in a linkedin post i fell in love with the field and with all the challenges and complexities it holds i m so grateful to have learned such important skills and worked with amazing faculty there were also projects related to covid 19 and pediatric cystic fibrosis that leveraged data from choc and a project on smartphones and infant language development used data from stephanie reich of uci s school of education the final team analyzed rainfall over time using data provided by phu nguyen and chrs students

september 22 2022 in july 2022 the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics welcomed hengrui cai as an assistant professor of statistics can you tell us a bit about your background and how you decided on statistics i m originally from southeastern china and i m the only child in my family growing up my mom and my grandma encouraged me to be independent and to seek a career i would enjoy and fight for my entire life when i took the exam to go to college i got full marks in mathematics this gave me the confidence to choose a mathematics related major as an undergraduate student at zhejiang university what inspired me to do a deep dive into the statistics major was the fourth industrial revolution happening during that time related to the realization of society version 5 0 we re in the process of imagining some new society where we will heavily rely on big data to solve challenges and to figure out how people can use artificial intelligence to live better therefore i decided to get a minor in the advanced honor class of engineering education at chu kochen honors college which granted me great opportunities to work with outstanding peers across the university and learn cutting edge technologies to integrate statistics and machine learning elegantly what motivated you to then earn your ph d during my undergraduate i attended several mathematical and machine learning competitions and won the meritorious winner in american mathematical contest yet i could still see my limitations in knowledge which motivated me to reach for the highest standard and become an expert in statistics and machine learning after a summer research internship at the university of alberta in canada i decided to go abroad for higher education and came to the united states after earning my bachelor s degree i spent five years at north carolina state university and got my ph d in statistics under the co supervision of dr wenbin lu and dr rui song my dissertation was on optimal decision making and policy evaluation with complex data which leverage causal inference and reinforcement learning to help us make the right decisions for the right people at the right time during that time i also spent three years interning at amazon that was another excellent opportunity for me to see the real world impact of computer science and statistics and how our research contributes to industry and society can you talk about your research focus i have broad research interests in methodology and theory in causal inference reinforcement learning and graphical modeling and in how they interact to establish reliable powerful and interpretable solutions to a variety of real world problems currently i m working in two main directions one is personalized decision making and policy evaluation for complex data this area integrates the techniques of causal inference and reinforcement learning which enables us to answer counterfactual questions so we can make better decisions in an interactive environment some use cases include precision medicine and personalized recommendations in e commerce i m also very interested in causal discovery with emerging challenges in big data this area leverages causal inference and graphical models to disentangle the complex relationship among variables and deliver the results in an explainable way my long term research goal is to teach a machine to learn the logic from the facts so what brought you to uci first of all i love irvine this city is vivid elegant and multicultural with a lot of young tech companies presenting appealing opportunities for collaboration the second reason is owing to the great research communities inside uci and around the uc system there are so many outstanding faculty members here i would like to work with in my department in the school of ics and across the university also where else can we find the departments of statistics computer science and informatics all in the same school it s a very unique place what courses will you be teaching i will be teaching a course in spring 2023 for undergraduates called introduction to probability and statistics in the future i would like to design some new courses on reinforcement machine learning and on causal discovery is there a book you d like to recommend to students the book of why by judea pearl and dana mackenzie this book is for non technical people who are interested in causal discovery explaining how we understand or formulate causality in real problems and highlighting the difference between correlation and causation it helps us understand the logic of things happening dive into the essence of human thought and use the causal principle as the key to applying artificial intelligence to solve real problems in meaningful ways what do you do in your spare time i like hiking going to the beach and being out in the sunshine i also like to go kayaking and standup paddle boarding if i have a bit more time i like to travel to new places i ve only been in irvine for a few months and i ve already been to las vegas death valley antelope valley and san francisco then from san francisco i drove down the coast to los angeles next i plan to visit san diego and yosemite work hard play hard i enjoy different views which open my eyes and my mind i also like to watch movies to experience different lives one of my favorites is forrest gump hengrui cai at death valley left and along california state route 1 right finally what do you like best so far about uci the people here are so nice i have received a lot of support from my department chair faculty members and department staff during my relocation and onboarding which is extremely helpful for the early stage of my career there are also plenty of opportunities for collaborating and i have been invited to give some talks for example i gave a talk in early september on optimal subgroup identification via constrained policy tree search for choc research i will continue to explore the fantastic research community at and around uci as i study how statistics and machine learning can uniquely contribute to interdisciplinary solutions and i will

third year he transitioned to computer science graduating with a b s in that discipline in 1974 in the mid 1970s uci established a master s degree program in computer science and butterworth was one of its early graduates uci is where i began my career as a computer scientist and software engineer he said while at uci i met another person who was a graduate student at the time and we ended up working together well into the 1980s you could say uci is where all of my success really started butterworth said he would not have been able to complete his college education without the monetary support he received as a student i was considering not going to the university unless i received financial aid because i didn t have any money but when uci came through with a package to help out that

long beach city council member watch her inauguration online starting at minute 58 30 as a child joni ricks oddie would often join her grandfather at county commissioner meetings in chicago so it s no surprise that when ricks oddie was sworn in for her new seat on the long beach city council on dec 22 2022 she had her family in tow she took her oath of office with her right arm raised and her left arm holding her young daughter as a wife and mother of two small children it is of utmost importance to me that we make our civic spaces open welcoming and inclusive teaching the next generation the necessity of civic engagement she said during her inauguration speech that lesson starts with them seeing their parents have the ability to be full members and make their voices heard i want to lead by example and let people know families are always welcome in addition to exemplifying her life as a mom in support of family friendly civic spaces ricks oddie also spotlighted her work in epidemiology and statistics in support of more impactful leadership as someone with a science and research background i want to bring data and metrics to the way we make decisions in the city she noted to ensure we are making the most well informed decisions on the ways we invest in our city particularly our most vulnerable communities ricks oddie earned her ph d in epidemiology from ucla and now serves as director of the center for statistical consulting housed in uc irvine s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics she is also director of the biostatistics epidemiology and research design berd unit within uci s institute for clinical and translational sciences icts this professional backdrop gives her a unique understanding of the power of data and as she takes on her new role as council member for the city of long beach representing district 9 she plans to leverage that knowledge to positively impact her community what was the most memorable part of your inauguration the official swearing is at the city clerk s office but the public inauguration ceremony was a ton of fun i had my friend and mentor yvonne wheeler who is president of the l a county federation of labor swear me in and my husband and two kids were supposed to be on stage with me but my son had to go to the bathroom he said he couldn t hold it so my father in law took him as i was giving my speech but it worked out perfectly because my speech talked about the importance of family and children and civic engagement the reason i bring my kids to everything is to make it an inclusive space for families i live in a community of young people of color so we have a lot of families moving in how are we going to grow the next generation of civic leaders if people aren t comfortable bringing their kids so it starts with us as leaders demonstrating that it s okay so just as i finish talking about this and i m shaking hands with some of the other city council members my father in law returns with my son i pick him up and give him a hug and then he says i wanna say something and he grabs the microphone and says hi i m cohen many people thought that was the highlight of the event it was a perfect example of the importance of family and just being a mom in the middle of all that so that was my favorite moment joni ricks oddie holding her son at the inauguration ceremony for the long beach city council how does your position as director of the center for statistical consulting help you in this role at my second city council meeting we announced an emergency declaration on homelessness we have an emergency operation center called the elc and we have around a 100 staff members in long beach dedicated to spending the next 100 days focusing completely on homelessness and sending us reports so the friday before our second meeting is when we got our homelessness report and it was 100 pages i had to read and analyze the report before our tuesday meeting this is the benefit of having somebody with a ph d who is used to looking at data and quickly determining what s happening joni ricks oddie at a city council meeting i ll give you another example there was a slide talking about race and ethnicity related to homelessness because we re trying to approach the problem with an equity lens to identify which racial groups are most heavily impacted in long beach it s african americans so on this one slide there were two data points that just seemed contradictory to each other one was saying that black people tend to spend the fewest days unhoused but they were also vastly more likely to be back on the street 12 months after being housed like 62 compared to the 20 for the next highest group which were white people so what the heck is happening that we get black people off the street quickly but within a year we are back where we started in the meeting i pointed out that this cycle is alarming i then had residents and advocates thanking me for the depth of my questions because i m not sure others had enough time to review the data to make that connection how do your efforts to address the needs of your community give you a different lens for viewing your work in academia it s the importance of implementation we do all this research but we often don t get to see the final dissemination and implementation how do we take what we do and literally translate it into something that impacts people that s exactly what i get the opportunity to do now which is why the work is so important it s basically asking how do you take best practices which is what we re supposed to be doing here as researchers and implement that but then the counterpoint is if we re trying to implement these policies what s the feedback loop to research that s what s missing which is why i think somebody with my background is important to have in a position like this we don t have the feedback loop to know which programs and policies didn t work out the way we thought they would when scaled for a larger audience but having that knowledge can inform how we do our research and create useful interventions you ve said that you want to advocate for an office of data and evaluation why is that important data is great and information is great but what are you going to do with it how can it influence policy and help you apply for grants that can lead to interventions i m hoping to demonstrate to my council colleagues over time that data tells you a story and then based on that story you can present a series of policies to address inequities the level of challenges that we re dealing with right now impresses the need for a holistic view we have to do many things all at once if we re actually going to make an impact which means you need to understand the full breadth of the issue i m building the case right now for eventually hiring a unit of people with expertise in gathering and analyzing data to get the whole story and give us that holistic view ricks oddie on the campaign trail with her daughter in addition to homelessness you also want to focus on health equity which became personal for you after the birth of your daughter how do you plan to tackle that issue when it comes to the issue around health equity this is actually related to black residents as well so i have been working over time with what s called the black health equity collaborative an organization born out of the framework for racial reconciliation that the city of long beach implemented right after the murder of george floyd the document was designed to make the city accountable toward its black residents it includes milestones metrics and objectives on how to engage with black residents out of that we started exploring how to tie things together to focus on communities of color we already had an office of equity we already had a health department but how do we make sure each community is getting the attention that it needs black residents need it latino residents need it our pacific islander groups need it including our samoans our tongans our chamorro population who are barely even a blip in the data they re never disaggregated out i talked to several of them when i was knocking on doors campaigning and they said they don t even feel visible most of the time at the city level so when we talk about health equity it s about being intentional about those communities that have been marginalized historically and don t even get a voice at the city level and really engaging them with them to uplift their voices and their needs there s a lot of work to do can you also talk about your efforts to expose underrepresented minority urm middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science stephanie reyes tuccio is the assistant vice chancellor for uci s center for educational partnerships cfep which has a group of managers under her that focus on urm students so statistics professor veronica berrocal and i participated in one of their workshops for students in the long beach paramount and compton school districts we did a presentation talking about statistics and what you can do with it and we recruited some students of color from the department of statistics to share their experiences i ve done a couple of presentations with veronica through the cfep talking about the work we do and trying to collaborate with them on projects so ics can be a partner in general but it s interesting because when talking about careers this isn t a pipeline problem it s a recruitment problem we need to better target urm student blocks and expose them to open positions i m a black woman so i have a much more diverse network but you have to be intentional about building a network that is diverse enough to attract the best candidate don t tell me there s no black people or latino people for a position they re out there what are we doing to find them this relates to your icts black thriving initiative strategic plan can you tell us about that after george floyd s murder icts the institute for clinical and translational science started a working group that fall a visioning process about how icts could join with uci s black thriving initiative bti we were trying to assess how we could leverage the resources at icts to double down on our commitment to diversity and make sure we were doing our due diligence to increase the diversity of the clinical translational sciences because historically as much work as it does icts as an entity has not been super diverse again it s just levels of intentionality so we drafted what i think is a comprehensive plan that leverages our strengths and talks about regional partnerships we came up with a series of goals metrics and objectives that map to the three pillars of bti leverage the mission change the culture and engage black communities that was fall of 2020 so how s it going it s been really great we ve been engaging with our education unit to get them to increase the number of nih diversity supplements contacting eligible researchers we ve had a lot of success with that over the last couple of years going from around two supplement applications to six with i think five out of those six being awarded we re also making sure our labs and research groups have culturally competent researchers so when students of color come in they have a sense of belonging and feel comfortable it s all these little interventions you need to do along the way to make things easier and more inclusive we also have a steering committee for the icts that meets every week and we have speakers come in quarterly to talk about different topics related to dei diversity equity and inclusion such as race as a biological versus social construct because race is often controlled and included in analyses and most people don t really know why they include race so we re teaching researchers to critically think about those things or we ve talked about precision of language we had a researcher dr monica mclemore of the university of washington talk about how people use words like equity diversity and inclusion and conflate all these terms without really understanding what they mean we ve also had people talk about workforce development in the clinical space to not only recruit a diverse set of students and faculty but also to think about our clinical trials because we re often testing things on a very specific group demographic we found out the problems of that during the pandemic i don t know if you heard about what happened with the pulse oximeters for measuring your blood oxygen levels but research has shown that the darker your skin the poorer the reading black people with darker skin would go into the emergency room saying i can t breathe but the pulse oximeter reading would say you re at 100 oxygen saturation so the doctors would say you re fine because the finger oximeter couldn t read through darker skin these are things we need to think about during clinical trials when we re testing devices the color of someone s skin matters this ties back into the question of what kind of data you re getting and whether you re getting the full picture from that data on that note and given that it s black history month is there something you d like to share as a source of inspiration there s a book called black like me it s old it s literally like a 50 year old book originally published in 1960 but it s basically the true story of a gentleman a journalist who s white john howard griffin who darkens his skin and then goes to live in the south as a black man it is a fantastic book because you re still the same person but once you remove the privilege of your skin the author experienced what it is like to live through the lens of not having the privilege of whiteness i remember reading that book back when i was maybe in high school and it s a great read and i still remember it to this day anything else you d like to add if there s anyone out there who s interested in the work i m doing on city council or who wants to be a resource or to bend joni s ear on an issue let me know there s going to be times when i m looking for subject matter expertise in particular areas obviously i talk about homelessness but there s tons of things that cities as large as long beach have to address so i d love to be able to interface with my colleagues here at uci and use them to get subject matter information to myself and my colleagues so please reach out shani murray uc irvine alumni paul and jo butterworth

strategy lead at snap inc uses airflow python git and bigquery machine learning matt weiss who is a data science manager at meta shared more holistic advice on building good mlops think of the whole

half of the discussion concluded with panelists sharing some mistakes they made in the workplace and the lessons they learned from those mistakes weiss in particular talked about an instance in which he analyzed and interpreted data based on his own assumptions without consulting his colleagues if you are creating anything make sure to check against something that s already been solved said weiss don t make assumptions and find the source of truth if you re trying to re create something you may have some big things you missed career developmentnooravi detailed the challenges she experienced when transitioning to her first career after college at her first job noovari was the youngest and only female employee on her team and several of her colleagues had ph d degrees or had more work experience than her leading her to feel and be isolated and have imposter syndrome i had managers who were very supportive i had friends who were very supportive noovari said explaining that her support system helped her overcome difficulties at work she also highlighted the importance of diversity in the technology industry sharing a time when she was asked to speak on a panel at a conference that typically only invited male speakers the conference later developed an all woman panel peach then asked the panelists several questions about what they wished they had done early on in their career and to give the audience advice on how to succeed in new roles weiss said taking big swings by making high impact decisions is a powerful way to move forward and talucci suggested asking for help when you need it and documenting processes especially when you re new anywhere i do this every time i m new to a job being able to document all the processes that you re going through is always helpful talucci said giving examples such as tracking failures taking screenshots and more to put in your documentation level setting according to noovari is another important skill that helps when working in teams or with stakeholders what i tend to do is err on the side of over communicating noovari said which she explains is a good strategy when being given requests with unrealistic deadlines because stakeholders better understand where she is in the process and can shift their expectations it s when they don t know what s going on is when i think issues come up the last major question of the night was what hard or soft skills will help people level up in their career intellectual curiosity weiss said specifically in my world i look for who can take the question and build the biggest impact and influence with their insights someone who s willing to go the extra mile but be able to really formulate everything from start to finish so they can sell it noovari emphasized developing your communication skills noting that this is not limited to verbal communication like speaking up in meetings i have a lot of introverts on my team and i tell them if it s a zoom call just add things in the chat they can be really good at communication via email written communication can be very strong and offset them not speaking up in meetings noovari said so being an introvert isn t a bad thing it s actually just finding a medium in which you can exercise your skills karen phan student creativity and innovation take center stage at hack at uci 2023faculty spotlight veronica

veronica berrocal tried to convince herself that she did not want to follow in her father s footsteps and study statistics today that young girl from italy is a professor of statistics at uc irvine s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics she has been named a fellow of the american statistical association asa for research in spatial and spatio temporal statistics and applications to atmospheric and environmental sciences and environmental epidemiology she has served as chair of the section in environmental sciences envibayes of the international society of bayesian analysis isba and she has advised the environmental protection agency epa sharing her statistical expertise on scientific advisory panels learn here what finally drew her to the field after years of resistance and how she s now sharing her passion for statistics with others illustrating its impact and importance how did you first become interested in statistics my dad studied statistics but when i was younger i didn t want to do what my dad did when i was in high school and considering what to study at the university i was very undecided my mom suggested that i study math since i really liked it and math has a large number of applications i remember her mentioning atmospheric sciences and weather forecasting so i decided on math stayed clear of anything that had to do with probability or statistics and ended up specializing in differential geometry after getting my b s and m s degrees in math i came to the u s to michigan state university on a scholarship to do research as part of this research i had to learn genetics and how to model genetics data since i did not know statistics i had to take some classes but ones offered not by the department of statistics and probability but by the department of animal science where i was conducting my research i started to take these classes with the goal of developing a model to identify ways to maximize animal production although the statistical topics were interesting i was not really satisfied with the application and the focus on animal production so i decided to take classes from the department of statistics and probability and get a master s in statistics as i did that i got more and more into it and that s how i found myself wanting to go for a ph d so that s how it all started it s funny because i actually ended up following in my dad s footsteps can you talk about how your work blends the fields of statistics and environmental science the environment and environmental science were things i was always interested in even though i didn t grow up in a family of people who typically go hiking camping or anything like that i was interested in animals and i ve always wanted to advocate for the weaker links seeing animals get mistreated trees get cut down or a piece of land get urbanized has always made me sad so i ve always been interested in environmental conservation and when i applied to the ph d program at the university of washington i saw on the webpage of my advisor adrian raftery a project that excited me he wanted to estimate the size of the whale population specifically the bowhead whale the whaling commission needed to establish the quota of whales that could be hunted per year so they needed to have an idea of how many whales there were in the wild that s not easy to determine as one needs to estimate the size of the population based on what one sees occasionally when i went to visit the department though i was told that the funding for the project was over i still ended up going there for my ph d and working with adrian on a project related to atmospheric sciences and weather as my mom predicted years before from there i got interested in developing and applying statistical methods to answer questions in atmospheric sciences e g weather climate air pollution so i ve been interested in this particular area of science for a long time of course now with the threats connected to climate change becoming more and more evident people are very interested in environmental science research in connection to human health and sustainability as well what projects are you working on i ve spent a considerable amount of time working on projects related to air pollution that was something i started to work on during my postdoc and i m still working on it in fact i m collaborating with jun wu here at uci on a couple of projects that are focused on estimating air pollution levels in california and quantifying the effect of wildfires particularly on pregnant women i have also recently been invited to be part of an advisory panel that will be reviewing a tool the epa has developed called ejscreen the tool lets you map and compare exposure to various environmental risk factors across space air pollution is of course one of the environmental risk factors that poses a threat to human health more recently i ve become interested in climate change not only for its effects on human health or natural habitats but also in terms of agricultural production at this point despite the climate disinformation campaign i hope everybody understands that the climate is changing and that global warming is real for me even though i know that addressing climate change requires making country level political decisions across the globe especially by the countries that are the biggest polluters i realized that i want to contribute to research on climate change more on the front of mitigation what can we do to mitigate the effects of climate change you re also helping expose underrepresented minority middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science can you talk a bit about those efforts i ve been thinking about the issue of diversity in statistics for a long time in part because i am mixed race and i never completely felt at ease in certain environments so i always think about how it feels to be a student in a field where you don t see many other people like you or you don t recognize your experience in the experience of your peers the only way things can change is if we increase the number of students and faculty from diverse backgrounds there is a lot of effort in trying to recruit students into the graduate program but i think we need to start a little bit earlier for some disciplines it s easy for students to think i want to become a doctor or i want to be an engineer because people are familiar with these careers but if you re not around people who are familiar with the department of statistics or the school of ics you might not really know about data science as i was thinking about how we might reach middle or high school students i talked to joni ricks oddie director of uci s center for statistical consulting joni had a connection with uci s center for educational partnerships cfep and she introduced me to the group we did our first panel discussion together with high school students from orange county after that first event i did other presentations with cfep i really enjoy talking to these kids and hope they will consider going to college for data science and maybe even grad school but even just getting them into data science as an undergraduate is a win there needs to be more outreach to put statistics and data science on the map for people as i gave these presentations i realized that many high school students don t know what data science is or what type of jobs one could do with a degree in data science many high school students also don t know what a professor does besides teaching you also did a seminar series on data science careers correct two years ago i got an ics inspiration award and i organized a seminar series on career paths that was meant to help graduate students because of the pandemic the seminars were all hosted on zoom despite not being in person i managed to invite people from different sectors so that they could give graduate students an idea of the types of careers they could pursue after completing either their master s or ph d degree with the seminars i also wanted to help take away the anxiety that students often have of thinking i have to figure out my life completely once i get my degree or i m stuck in a certain career for the rest of my life i wanted students to know that there are many different paths that one can construct our first speaker violeta hennessey works at paramount pictures she got her ph d in biostatistics at md anderson and is now the director of paramount s digital archives and analytics another speaker luke bornn used to be the vice president of strategy and analytics for an nba team and now is co founder of a sports analytics company but he started as a professor we also had speakers in more traditional careers a data scientist who works at google a director of biostatistics within a pharmaceutical company a professor focused mostly on statistical education and a researcher who works in a government lab all the speakers talked about how they built their career and what types of problems or projects they typically work on students really liked it anyone interested in viewing the seminars can contact me how has public awareness around statistics changed since you first entered the field i can definitely say that even though i have only been a faculty member for 13 or 14 years i can see the impact of statistics on public discourse i remember when i was still an assistant professor at the university of michigan and i got invited as an ad hoc member to join advisory panels i would often be the only statistician on the panel the rest of the panel was composed of toxicologists and environmental health scientists now i get emails where the epa explicitly states that they are looking for people with biostatistics or statistics expertise to serve on this or that advisory panel and i think that s true for many other advisory panels more and more the importance of statistics is being recognized and statisticians are getting more involved in the public discourse i think this really speaks to the impact of statistics it s women s history month any women in stem trailblazers you want to spotlight keeping it close to the areas of statistics that i work in there are two women that i would like to highlight francesca dominici from harvard university was among the first statisticians to work on studies that assess the impact of air pollution on health using very large population level studies she has contributed to evidence on the adverse health effects of air pollution and her work continues to have enormous impact i really look up to her also anybody who works in bayesian statistics and spatial and environmental epidemiology knows sylvia richardson her work on bayesian computation mcmc and on spatial modeling are part of fundamental knowledge for anybody who works in spatial epidemiology from a bayesian perspective our own department of statistics also has two trailblazers jessica utts and annie qu jessica s impact on statistical education is long lasting thousands of students have learned statistics in their undergraduate classes using one of jessica s books and annie s research breadth and contribution to statistics are quite hard to match i don t think there are many statisticians who have never encountered her name on a statistical paper seen her name on the program of a statistical conference or seen her give a presentation so we don t have to go far to find inspiring women shani murray mds

emily truong moves to the rhythm of algorithms march 16 2023 as a dancer fourth year honors student emily truong has seen countless injuries around her she wanted to study dance and biology on a pre medicine track and become a doctor however after exploring the field of data science truong learned about the large scale impact she can make on the healthcare industry through data and was inspired to double major in dance and data science during my first year i took all these math classes and i was looking into which pathways use a lot of math says truong she also shadowed data scientists at a financial technology firm and self taught herself python the summer before college i thought data science could be an interesting pathway to go through so i started taking some data science classes and realized that i really liked it truong shared that her experience of touring uci was memorable and unique compared to other schools she toured which is one of the reasons she decided to attend uci one thing i remembered about uci was my campus tour guide said that uci was the first school to reverse boil an egg she says i thought uci was really pretty and calm truong is also minoring in bioinformatics and says research is a big part of her time at uci research is how she blends her passion for medicine with data since her second year truong has worked with health researchers as a research assistant in informatics professor kai zheng s lab she is also a student manager and supervises fellow student researchers in the lab she is especially proud of a yearlong study she worked on that examined pre and post covid 19 opioid overdoses which will be published and presented in april at the uc real world evidence conference currently truong is working with uci health s all of us database to gather information on patient recruitment in clinical trials join clubs and organizations a lot of research positions are passed down that way networking is also really important she says adding that contacting professors directly and reading emails from the ics student affairs office are other ways to find openings in research labs outside of her data science classes and research at uci truong is part of the engineering fraternity theta tau where she created a gesture controlled automated curtain with her fraternity brothers this past summer she interned at kaiser permanente and worked with data on hypertension heart attack and stroke outcomes and suicide prevention truong has spent the second half of her college career focused on research and learning more about data science to prepare herself for a career in data science her double major in dance and data science helps her balance the stress and demands of her math and computer science classes because she enjoys the creativity stimulation and exercise in her dance classes after i come out of computer science class i m like oh i m so tired but after i go to dance class it boosts my energy says truong it s a really nice balance when she graduates truong hopes to continue dancing recreationally many of the soft skills she applies to her research and internship experience in data science come from dancing which she has been doing since she was 5 years old she says her work ethic time management and planning skills and creativity all come from dancing one of emily s hobbies is crocheting her latest creation is this frog with a busy school schedule truong turns to a few activities and hobbies to de stress she is part of a dance team on campus called project renegade and the sorority tri delta and enjoys attending dance performances on campus to support her peers she also likes to spend time with her friends and crochet her most recent creation is a frog truong is interested in careers in data science that will allow her to influence people and improve lives at scale her internship at kaiser permanente has also inspired her to pursue a graduate degree in data science and a role in predictive analysis one of the things that brought me into data science was realizing that i could do a lot of work behind the scenes and actually impact a lot of people at once she says karen phan faculty

science for both data uci and the wider community of data enthusiasts at uci colin yee a second year data science major and vice president of community development at data uci says planning the club s inaugural datathon would not have been possible without the dedication and marketing efforts of their board members and interns since this is our first datathon we had to essentially start from scratch says yee one of the biggest challenges was securing data challenges and funding for our event we ve sent hundreds of emails and linkedin messages to different companies and organizations with a dozen at most responding back we were very glad of the sponsors and funding we were able to receive according to data uci president and third year data science major william hou the club s hard work paid off the datathon exceeded hou s expectations before it officially began our team has never put on an event like this before so there was a lot of uncertainty especially when we first started planning around whether people would actually sign up says hou we ended up not only meeting our attendance goal but actually having to waitlist some of our applicants due to capacity limitations hou also expresses excitement about successfully putting a data related spin on traditional software hackathons adding that data uci plans to host a bigger and better datathon next year data uci hopes to build a strong reputation for its collegiate datathon in the years to come in the meantime hou and yee encourage students to continue participating in datathons you have the opportunity to work in a team and analyze data from different companies and organizations says yee a datathon like this can help motivate students to learn different data related applications and to implement the skills they

establish a data science major uc irvine has been an educational leader in this growing field for close to a decade in addition to launching the major in 2015 uci recently started hosting summer programs for both high school and undergraduate students interested in data analytics and biostatistics and its socal data science program helps recruit train and dispatch a diverse workforce of stem and data science majors now the socal data science program is scaling up thanks to a 1 3 million pathways development grant from the california education learning lab the socal data science programthe socal data science program kicked off in 2022 with a three year 1 5 million grant from the national science foundation the program is a collaborative effort between faculty from uci california state university fullerton csuf and cypress college and the inaugural cohort of 32 fellows drawn from all three campuses attended a one week training bootcamp and conducted a six week research project at uci last summer professor babak shahbaba with the program welcoming 30 new fellows later this month statistics professor babak shahbaba of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics is already looking to the future as we are working with this new cohort finishing the second year we re thinking about continuity and sustainability says shahbaba the program lead at uci we don t want the program and the benefit that it provides to end when the nsf grant ends the new four year pathways development grant guarantees that the benefits will continue creating a pipeline of talentthe grant proposal titled pipe line programs for institutional pathway engagement accelerating infrastructure and education outlines ways to develop pathways and overcome equity gaps in data science learning csuf will serve as the host organization with professor jessica jaynes as project lead partnering closely with faculty from uci riverside city college rcc and rio hondo college rhc this grant will help us continue and expand our activities around data science education at the undergraduate level says shahbaba and this actually goes beyond the students it includes developing training materials and hosting workshops for instructors to build the required infrastructure the socal data science program aligns perfectly with the california learning lab s grand challenge on building critical mass for data science the learning lab wanted to establish this relationship between different tiers of academic institutes in california and we were already doing that with a uc cal state and community college says shahbaba the pipe line proposal has three overarching goals create pathways in data science between the three institutional tiers by establishing new courses and programs address equity gaps in data science education by expanding access to technology resources incorporating culturally relevant pedagogy and applying a content with context approach and support a diverse group of faculty and students in data science resulting in a robust community of data science learners the proposal doesn t extend the number of fellows 120 expected to be funded with the nsf grant rather it helps ensure other students have access to the same type of data science education outside of the program it s more about building the infrastructure to replicate the training that we ve been providing to these fellows and to scale it up says shahbaba as part of this work ics will host training workshops and an annual data science education conference helping instructors establish data science courses at community colleges and building a strong sense of community and at cal state fullerton adds shahbaba we will look into setting up a data science major and minor this creates a pipeline of talent for not only industry but for graduate programs as well we provide this program to help the students but also it helps uci in a way explains shahbaba two of the fellows from cal state fullerton in last year s cohort were among the 11 students accepted into uci s statistics ph d program this year so it s a two way gateway we transfer the knowledge and experience that we have developed over many years and in return we re recruiting these highly diverse skilled and motivated students pipe line thus aims to arm the next generation of data scientists with the knowledge and tools needed to tackle tomorrow s biggest challenges students well trained in data science at the undergraduate level strengthen data analytics in all industries from healthcare to transportation and support graduate level statistical research that will advance our understanding of issues ranging from disease prevention to climate change leading to novel solutions shani murray ics and engineering

students from the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics started their procession into the bren events center for the ics commencement ceremony this is the last but certainly not least of the 11 ceremonies said dean marios c papaefthymiou in his welcoming remarks to the crowd of students families and friends and esteemed faculty students at the 2023 ics commencement ceremony this celebration of the roughly 815 undergraduate degrees 160 graduate degrees and 275 professional masters degrees that ics expects to confer this year began with an inspiring rendition of the national anthem performed by aerodynamix an a capella group of uci students the class of 2023 heard from classmate nadia etemadi who spoke of her journey to becoming a software developer and from featured speaker julia white chief marketing and solutions officer at the enterprise software company sap who offered words of wisdom from her nearly 30 years in the tech industry first however provost and executive vice chancellor hal stern congratulated the students the students that we re celebrating especially many of the undergraduates had a remarkable educational experience he noted impacted by a global pandemic that changed the world in ways that nobody could have imagined he commended the students for their ability to maintain their focus on projects problem sets labs and reports and for their personal growth you ve been challenged in classes and in your conversations with your friends to accept understand and challenge different points of view said stern highlighting a core element of the college experience society needs more people with the ability to listen to give people the benefit of the doubt and to engage in civil conversation with those with whom we disagree emphasizing that commencement marks a new beginning stern challenged the students to do all the little things you can to make the world a better place and to find your passion and pursue it building on communities of supportdean marios then introduced etemadi an iranian american graduating with her master s degree in software engineering as etemadi took the stage she transported the audience back in time imagine for a moment that it s the year 2013 she started i was a nervous wreck of a 14 year old sitting in my counselor s office in selecting the last elective for her first year of high school she had to choose between woodshop or intro to computer programming she remembered calling her mom for advice ever the cautious parent she suggested computer programming i can t exactly chop my arm off with a keyboard and mouse said etemadi laughing that one decision ended up cultivating a love of programming within me she said dragging and dropping code blocks in scratch might have just been another elective course for some kids but for me it was a window into a whole new world after high school etemadi s dreams of attending an elite college came crashing down when she was rejected everywhere she applied so she found another path she attended west valley community college where she found a community of incredibly talented compassionate professors and students she went on to study computer science at uc davis where she again found a community of supportive classmates the culmination of which was a zoom graduation in her living room as a graduate student at uci her initial online connections flourished with the return to on campus learning and she collaborated with fellow graduate students and research lab members with help from her advisor andre van der hoek she developed a prototype tool that lets people edit videos to attach to bug reports now as she prepares to find a job as a software developer she looks forward to meeting yet another community of talented and supportive peers and colleagues she wishes the same for her fellow graduates advising the class of 2023 to carve out a space for themselves that builds on their unique experiences memories and communities from uci student speaker nadia etemadi and her advisor informatics professor andre van der hoek finding the constant in an ever changing worldwhite who earned her b a from stanford university and mba from harvard and who spent 20 years at microsoft before joining sap acknowledged that commencement speakers often talk of unprecedented times yet for this class of 2023 she stressed that these times are truly unprecedented she talked not only of the start of their college journey and the resilience required during the global pandemic but also of the end of their journey as they enter the workforce at the dawn of the next massive revolution in technology with artificial intelligence she assured the students that armed with a world class education they are well prepared for the challenges and opportunities that await them the bren school has prepared you with the latest technology skills the ability to think critically and hands on experiences at some of the most innovative organizations in the world she also spoke to the first generation college students who made up nearly half of the graduating class you re creating a new legacy for your family and community which is remarkable she went on to share what she has learned from her nearly 30 years of working in technology which started with launching online banking at intuit technology is always advancing but there s no technology advancement without people she compared today s angst about ai s impact on jobs to what she saw back in 2007 with the cloud revolution as she helped move companies away from their server rooms to cloud based services she recognized the importance of retraining it professionals providing opportunities for career advancement as well as for further cloud innovation humanity needs to be at the center of everything we do in technology stressed white we re so lucky to have the skills the know how to help the world run better through technology it s an awesome opportunity and a massive responsibility calling on the class of 2023 to act as values based tech minded leaders she acknowledged that it s a tumultuous time do not lose hope because today every company is a tech company retailers manufactures banks automotive companies nonprofit governments all of them are in dire need of your skills every company now competes and differentiates with technology she also acknowledged the power of ai but insisted it s still just a tool one that you will be at the forefront of guiding and harnessing she then implored the next generation of tech leaders to use their knowledge and skills to improve society prioritizing responsible and ethical development tech will always advance let your values and ethics be the constant in an ever changing world featured commencement speaker julia white of sap the strongest anteater zot to conclude the ceremony dean marios asked all of the family and friends to stand as he recognized their support in helping the students achieve this tremendous accomplishment then after this moment of gratidude he announced that it was time for the competitive part of the event it is a competition among the schools for the strongest anteater zot he explained asking for everyone to join him in three emphatic zots the class of 2023 with excitement and uci pride readily obliged zot zot zot i hear that was the best announced dean marios offering one final accolade for these ics graduates before sending them off to start the next chapter of their lives shani murray faculty and staff honored at 2023 ics

generation of computer scientists software designers game developers and tech experts ensuring students have the hands on training and real world experience needed to excel after graduation this year ics further increased expo excitement and engagement by adding a judging component and awarding 20 000 in prizes across four different programs ics is raising the bar every year always thinking outside the box when it comes to providing the technical expertise and skillsets students need for success says ics director of corporate relations jason king and we could not do this without our industry partners who offer unique opportunities for professional development and mentorship the capstone experiencethe projects on display were completed for undergraduate capstone courses in informatics computer science and game design for the ics honors program and for the butterworth product development competition these programs benefit not only students who gain opportunities for practical application and important soft skills but also benefit program sponsors who gain opportunities for recruitment and support for under resourced projects once again there was a wide range in the diversity of projects covering domains ranging from web development and social media to ai and machine learning to all the hot topics of the day says informatics professor hadar ziv who taught the first informatics capstone course in ics back in 2009 in fact two of the three winning projects for informatics were in the medical field with a direct impact on society these projects were beatingmelanoma com sponsored by hoag and memory air which enhances memory recall through the sense of smell there were also novel games on display in game design we talk a lot about polish making those small adjustments that take a game from good to great capstone is the class where they get to see a project all the way through says informatics professor kurt squire who led the capstone projects for the game design and interactive media major the students work closely with industry mentors who can point them to resources and processes that go beyond what any one faculty can do alone computer science professor sergio gago masague who leads the capstone course for the department of computer science also highlights the benefits for students the program gives students the opportunity to apply their computer science skills and knowledge to real world problems and to closely work with industry partners to develop innovative solutions he says it is a great opportunity to learn and

glassdoor s list of the 50 best jobs in american for 2020 which shouldn t be too surprising given the rise of big data and growing demand for empirical based decision making across many industries to help meet this demand the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics is currently accepting applications for the new master of data science mds program it is launching in the fall of 2021 anyone interested in joining the inaugural cohort of this 15 month professional graduate program can apply online the early application deadline is december 15th 2020 after that applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until april 15th 2021 we see lots of demand coming from individuals who were trained in computer science for example without rigorous statistical training says daniel gillen chair of the department of statistics we also see demand coming from individuals who were trained in mathematical sciences and statistics but don t have the computing background he continues and then there are a lot of individuals coming from other disciplines as well from business analytics backgrounds and from political and social science backgrounds so whether you re in the tech industry at a financial institution in a domain such as education or healthcare or a recent graduate looking for more training this program is designed to advance your data science skills while there are minimum course requirements the goal is to fill certain gaps in training while providing practical hands on experience what makes this program unique is that it is going to be taught and delivered by world renowned experts in the foundations of data science meaning both statistics and computing says gillen the courses will cover applied probability and mathematical statistics statistical modeling and computing machine learning data management and visualization and artificial intelligence more importantly they will be evenly split between faculty from the department of statistics and the department of computer science both of which are housed in the school of ics industry is learning very quickly that a lot of people can scrape and analyze data but to do something truly meaningful with data to make decisions that will drive the industry forward you really have to have a basic foundational understanding of the methods you re using says gillen that is what drives the philosophy of this degree the program spans five quarters with the first three quarters comprising coursework in both statistics and computer science the summer quarter is available for internships or additional courses to accommodate working professionals all courses will be offered in the late afternoon or evening and for those in need of financial assistance scholarships and financial aid are available the final quarter is the capstone course where students will work on industry derived projects gaining real world hands on experience we plan to partner with businesses to help generate not only contacts for students but also interesting capstone projects if your business is interested in sponsoring a capstone project please contact bryan munoz at mds ics uci edu furthermore because this program adds to the list of successful professional programs already offered through the school of ics students will have access to dedicated career counselors and will participate in showcase events so while the goal is to keep the initial mds cohort relatively small students will be able to leverage resources and events available through the established graduate programs it will be fairly selective so we re aiming at 50 students for the first cohort says gillen though that might grow in future years this select group of students will gain experience in using relevant data related software and technologies so they can thrive as data scientists whether their goal is to work in the tech industry or government or anywhere in between we re going to focus on taking what is learned about the foundations of these disciplines stresses gillen and applying them to real world data shani murray a campus gem uci s statistical consulting servicesa look at health and technology trends for 2021 and

statistics current course listings news seminars news seminar center for statistical consulting a look at health and technology trends for 2021 and beyond january 15 2021 the fields of computer science informatics and statistics have been influencing healthcare for decades and 2020 served as an important reminder of the critical role both healthcare and technology play in people s daily lives the covid 19 pandemic put a spotlight on healthcare while stay at home orders significantly boosted technology use in general and telehealth practices in particular looking to the new year ahead how might the connections between technology and health become further entwined and how will this impact the future of healthcare here to address these questions are three professors from the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics yunan chen associate professor of informatics whose research focuses on human computer interaction hci computer supported cooperative work cscw and health informatics nikil dutt distinguished professor of computer science who studies embedded systems healthcare iot computer aided design and brain inspired architectures and computing and bin nan professor of statistics who works to improve human health through the development of statistical and machine learning methods professors chen dutt and nan each discuss new opportunities and challenges as advances in technology lead to fundamental shifts in the healthcare industry how is your field influencing the healthcare industry and what changes do you expect to see in the next few decades yunan chen chen informatics has had a huge influence on the healthcare industry the medical field is centered on the use of information in fact the field of medical informatics was established to meet the growing demand to collect access and use health data and information in the past five to 10 years health it systems have almost completely transformed paper based medical practices into electronic health records as everything becomes digitalized huge amounts of information and data can be collected and shared across practices opening the door to new clinical research and health policies another major influence stems from the digitalization of our everyday life with advances in consumer facing health it applications individuals can now collect manage and use personal health data that was not available in the past this information can then be shared with clinicians to benefit their practices across different settings clinical home or communities informatics research and applications are helping people better access information gather data and engage in evidence based practices leading to improved public health nikil dutt dutt one big shift we re seeing is this notion of digital health the idea of using technology for better self care it s this whole idea that even the field of medicine is recognizing called p4 health which is predictive preventive personalized and participatory health instead of the traditional model of episodic healthcare where you go to the doctor or er when you re sick we re moving toward proactively shifting the emphasis to earlier phases in terms of lifestyle digital health technologies including computer science informatics and statistics are the key enablers moving us in that direction we ve always talked about personalized health but now technology lets us use data and statistics to build models of individuals that can improve the quality of healthcare by delivering services in a more targeted fashion another tremendous shift we have seen just this past year is the move to remote healthcare and telehealth covid 19 accelerated the move to delivering services using technology the other thing that we ll be soon talking about is integrating mental and physical health far too often physical and mental care are siloed and services are provided in a completely uncoordinated fashion so i see a big change with personalization and this ability to integrate all of that information in a manner that can help healthcare professionals better do their jobs and more importantly help individuals empower themselves to make decisions in an informed manner bin nan nan statistics plays a very important role in any health related research the field of so called biostatistics is evidence of that where the emphasis is on health and medical research i can name many interesting influential topics such as survival analysis and longitudinal data analysis in the past two decades technology has evolved so that people can perform fine sequencing of dna information there are also many impacts along the lines of imaging especially in neuroscience research the brain is a very interesting organ that you usually cannot access so you can t directly measure brain activity you have to rely on imaging in both areas massive data are generated and that motivates some interesting statistical research in a fast growing area called high dimensional statistics in the coming years people will increasingly use wearable devices to track data including activity data and heartbeat and temperature measurements this presents statistical challenges in terms of how you analyze the data and how you design interventions to improve human health such as a message that says you should exercise more or you need to relax i m part of uci s new institute for future health ifh led by ramesh jain and the focus is on trying to understand how we collect and use mobile device data to improve health this will be a very interesting field that s depending on technology involvement as wearable devices with well designed apps become more and more available to people so we call this the big data era new statistical methods are being developed and some of them will become much more impactful in these scientific areas which will certainly reshape scientific knowledge in the future what about covid 19 s influence how did the global pandemic impact your research chen covid is not only a global public health crisis but also an information crisis our past research in this area shows that during a public health crisis information is often uncertain and ambiguous challenging how people perceive personal risks and make decisions it is crucial for informatics researchers like us to examine the use of information and technologies during this challenging time i ve been doing a multicultural study on contact tracing technologies for covid 19 in the u s korea and japan working with informatics professor daniel epstein and a group of international collaborators we started looking at human tracers and technology tracers and under different conditions when people prefer humans versus technology one of our findings to be presented at chi 21 is that when people have to report their symptoms during a 14 day quarantine they prefer technology check ins but when being notified of a covid positive diagnosis or of exposure to the virus people prefer to talk to a human so they can ask questions and receive emotional assurance right now we re doing a similar study in korea and also a survey in japan as they recently rolled out their national covid tracing system i ve also worked on a collaborative project looking into people s risk perceptions during the pandemic and how those perceptions might change as the pandemic wears on again findings to be presented at chi 21 in another study we looked into the beliefs of those who oppose facial masks we used a combination of machine learning and qualitative content analysis methods to analyze twitter data from january to october 2020 this study reveals the temporal trend of public opinions and the reasons why some people do not support mask wearing helping us understand public concerns and learn how to better communicate health policies to the public dutt one of the big projects i m working on is called unite underserved communities which provides services so that underserved pregnant women can take better care of themselves the project uses what we call a community health worker model where a community health worker traditionally goes in and visits with the mom periodically what we were looking at is how wearable technology can provide ubiquitous continuous monitoring that closes the loop by augmenting what happens during the physical visits we re doing the pilot study now so covid actually allowed us to test this intervention which became even more important when health workers could no longer visit the women at their homes so i think that provided us with an opportunity to test it and show that digital services can help people in this instance pregnant moms take better care of themselves also together with psychology professor jesse borelli we were looking at stress management of college kids we started this before covid recruiting between 10 to 30 students for each cohort using a combination of physiological monitoring with wearables and ecological momentary assessment ema questionnaires delivered on an app we combined the students physical health with their mental health state to evaluate and track their stress levels over time and provide feedback as covid hit we saw huge rises in stress levels it was extremely important to see what these kids were going through but it s also very exciting to use these digital technologies to build a personalized model nan covid did not interrupt my research too much since most of my research activities are now on zoom meanwhile i got a chance to work with professor jonathan watanabe from the uci school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences who is interested in how doctors treat covid 19 patients he was trying to understand the patterns of different medicine use over time among different patient categories the data set that we used was from the electronic health records another source of big data for health research of the uc system we have five medical schools and many many hospitals in the uc system and we have access to that data which is updated on a daily basis about what medicines were prescribed to the patients this is observational and descriptive not a clinical evaluation but it s very interesting work covid 19 has also highlighted racial disparities in healthcare what role do you think racial justice plays in healthcare and technology chen it definitely plays a huge role there have been recent studies outside of the healthcare world about how if the training data of ai systems does not include a certain population then the algorithms developed based on such data might lead to potential bias in the healthcare field i could imagine such scenarios in future ai assistant practices if the systems don t have enough training data for underrepresented populations or economically disadvantaged communities that could lead to serious consequences since we don t have universal healthcare in the u s it s really hard for some people to afford certain treatments for example infertility treatments if a technology is developed based on patient data with participation only by people who can afford it then bias can be embedded into the design i ve also seen studies looking into how technology can help clinicians avoid implicit bias when treating patients if they subconsciously describe things differently to different patients or maybe use a different tone or style of interaction if we look at the future of the entire healthcare industry and insurance more broadly there have been some articles about how if you are inherently prone to develop some kind of disease based on your medical history we would have different kinds of insurance that s one of the ethical issues we discuss in my medical informatics class with more algorithms and decision support being deployed in the healthcare field we need to be careful to not widen health disparity or inequity through technology design dutt that s so important we have a planning grant with nursing colleagues professor amir rahmani and dean adey nyamathi for a new nsf program called the future of work our grant digital health for future of community centered care is looking at community centered care because we all know that a large part of the cost of healthcare comes from training doctors and nurses but if you look at underserved populations community workers are the ones who actually interface with people and then report back to nurses or doctors so we feel that technology can empower and grow these types of services to help underserved communities especially in this climate so you asked what role does racial justice play and i m kind of turning that around saying technology has a tremendous role to play in providing services for the most underserved communities an example is the work we re doing through unite with moms orange county but i think we can take that kind of model and scale it i ll give you two instances that we ve discussed one is looking at mechanisms to help deliver services to the homeless community and another one is the meals on wheels program which delivers food to typically underserved elderly populations and these individuals are not only underserved but also might be going through life changes where they may be having early onset of dementia or they might not be taking care of themselves so how can we use technology to help identify problems early and communicate and address that nan in healthcare we see racial discrepancies all the time for example i was involved in a project looking at medicare data for end stage renal disease patients usually the standard treatment is dialysis for this cms centers for medicare medicaid services project we developed measures to evaluate the performance of dialysis facilities one of the issues we often see is racial discrepancy it s always there sometimes disparities can be explained biologically different genetic makeup for example but many are actually due to the social economic status how to address that is the billion dollar question people of color have disadvantages in terms of access to quality healthcare which directly impacts their health status there s a big debate about universal healthcare but i think that in a rich country like the u s everyone should have a certain level of care what other major challenges do we as a society need to address in the next five years chen now that we are able to collect a large amount of personal health data both by healthcare professionals and consumers the major challenge we face is how to better utilize such data to meet the diverse needs of stakeholders we often hear clinicians complaining about not having enough time to review the data patient brought to the clinic or patients being confused or distressed by their own health data there are structured constraints in our healthcare system that do not allocate physicians enough time to perform the data work brought on by new technologies on the consumer side users might not have sufficient knowledge skills and literacy to manage their own data and health how do we design health it systems that both provide data access as well as allow appropriate use of such data avoiding unintended negative consequences so beyond the technical aspect the human and social aspects of design are even more important how do you visualize and present the data to different stakeholders sometimes the systems also generate suggestions or predictions you might get diabetes if you continue leading this kind of lifestyle or if a prediction says you won t get pregnant in the next five days do you trust it and who is taking responsibility for the consequences we need to design technologies to not only collect data but also present it in a way that makes sense and that addresses diverse users data needs and to let users understand their data instead of over trusting it we did a fertility technology study and found the technology implicitly placed both physical and emotional burden on individuals trying to conceive many apps were following social norms making the women not their partners track the data but is that really the right way to do it so that s part of the challenge we need more experts who can connect both the technical side and the medical health side to create better healthcare technologies dutt one of the biggest challenges is finding how we move from episodic event based medical care to a model that s more integrated holistic and proactive this requires us to personalize the model to the individual spanning not only biomarkers to show if you re at risk for say heart disease but also the mental health aspect breaking down siloed healthcare to deliver integrated services will be critical this challenge transcends computer science and goes to the root of how policymakers and the government look at and fund healthcare in society if you look at how we re trying to achieve this vision of empowering people and developing personal models we can do that in smaller pilot studies but achieving it in practice is a huge challenge the other major barrier is privacy which varies not only from person to person but also very importantly as a person s health condition changes i m a healthy young adult and i m invincible so i don t want to share my data but you take an aging individual and there you get into all kinds of issues maybe in principle they don t want to share their health information but because of their condition they might need to maybe they re suffering from dementia it s a very complicated issue so how can we develop policies and infrastructures that can manage the privacy requirements of healthcare as the health state of an individual changes over time that s a very interesting aspect that colleagues here including professor sharad mehrotra have been working on nan again focusing on statistical research in health one of the greatest challenges in the next five years will be better understanding deep learning ai algorithms and being able to do some sort of reliable statistical inference on those models deep learning algorithms have been very successful in many areas of health research especially in radiology there are many interesting examples of the machine doing better than even the best trained radiologists when you have huge amounts of data you can train the algorithm to do more precise diagnoses but one challenge from the statistical side is trying to understand the effects of the predictors for example the risk factors to a disease statisticians build simple models that are easily interpretable but deep learning algorithms are usually a black box type of thing we don t really know what s going on inside the black box the algorithm can usually achieve a pretty good prediction but we still need to understand it more in order to find modifiable risk factors to improve people s health or to gain knowledge of disease mechanisms so we ll need statisticians and computer science researchers working together to open the black box finally what research will you be focused on in the coming year chen i m going to continue focusing on data driven technologies and examining the data work of individuals engaging in their everyday health practices we re doing a project on asthma with one of my ph d students imagine you have an inhaler that tracks your locations and notes where you take medications and senses certain environmental variables so how do individuals their caregivers and their healthcare providers benefit from such data and how can we design the right technologies to support their data work increasingly these data driven technologies are coupled with ai to provide algorithmic advice such as suggestions or predictions if the app tells you when and where you are more likely to have an asthma attack would you trust and follow such a prediction how do you make sure that the ai is accurate so i think on both the clinical and patient sides that s a really interesting direction i ll be working on including as it relates to smart health technology such as the smart diaper that tells you when it needs to be changed or the smart app that predicts your fertility window or tells you when to feed your baby increasingly society which is enthusiastic about data and ai is going to push for changes in how we manage our health and lifestyles so we need to make sure these technologies are designed properly dutt some exciting projects are in the works through the new institute for future health ifh we talked about unite and mental health and another area is food because what we eat can affect our mood and our physical health so a new line of research we ve started looking into together with professors ramesh jain and amir rahmani in the school of nursing relates to the new topic of food computing another ongoing effort is in pain assessment where we are trying to quantify the level of pain for subjects who are not able to communicate such as people just coming out of surgery or neonatal infants this will help doctors and nurses determine whether to administer pain medication and how much we re doing a small study with the uci medical center looking at some post operative patients to create a baseline and build a model using facial monitoring and measuring facial muscles and sweat and heart rate it s very exciting finally using data sets that we can access through the uc system we re doing covid detection intervention and prediction studies so it s quite a portfolio of projects and i am really excited that i m at uci it s a pleasure to wake up every morning and work with all these really bright people nan my personal research is on aging in general and alzheimer s disease in particular one of the problems i m thinking about is how to estimate alzheimer s disease prevalence a challenging issue is in survival analysis which is my field of interest the commonly used mathematical models implicitly assume that people can live forever you don t say people have to die before age 150 even though that s what we observe in the real world in fact that kind of modeling assumption is very hard to handle for aging studies which focus on the end of life so the idea i m proposing is to look at people who have already died to see who developed the disease during their lifetime and who didn t where the lifetimes are finite that s clearer information trying to understand during a lifetime who developed the disease when it happened and how it relates to certain risk factors it s natural to ask the question in a forward way how many people will get the disease in the next five years but my way of thinking is also going backwards looking at people s entire lifetimes to hopefully provide more precise estimation about this disease and a better evaluation of risk factors this is a new framework totally different from what people have been doing in the past and hopefully it will lead to important discoveries shani murray uci launches new professional program master of data scienceamstat news celebrating women in statistics 2021 annie qu

s really a career path in sports related to uci s data science major if so the webinar series being offered by the sport statistics group uci through the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics should be of interest to you the next webinar to be held on may 21 2021 will feature brendan kent a senior business data analyst at draftkings and creator and host of the measurables podcast there s a lot of interest around sports research right now says statistics professor michele guindani who is helping ph d student corey brett katz lead the new group along with statistics professors hal stern and weining shen sports excites many people so we ve started hosting seminars to introduce students to the types of problems one might work on in sports stats providing a behind the scenes look at sports statsin the february webinar presenting sports research to an average sports fan espn senior sports analytics specialist paul sabin talked about the work that goes into providing the game predictions shared by espn newscasters and appearing on the channel s news ticker the sport statistics group s february webinar featured espn senior sports analytics specialist paul sabin in particular he recounted his first few months at espn when he was tasked with improving the college basketball power index bpi leading into the 2016 ncaa basketball tournament using a bayesian model with coefficients such as home team or away team and distance traveled he did a posterior predictive distribution which espn started using for its on air predictions after the final four games for the men s tournament the model sabin developed gave villanova a 50 1 chance to win the championship over north carolina people don t realize that 50 1 and 49 9 are essentially the same thing statistically they ve very similar explained sabin regardless the prediction running along the bottom of the espn channel had villanova with its 50 1 favored to win when you work in sports you start having these rooting interests that have nothing to do with anything rational admitted sabin who had no ties to either school and didn t really care who won yet based on his model espn had predicted a villanova win so he suddenly became very invested in that outcome i have never been more nervous than i was at this moment he replayed the moment he was referring to during the webinar transporting viewers to the final seconds of the 2016 championship just as north carolina tied the game well my model was very close 50 and the game is tied with five seconds left he recalled thinking at the time that s what the highest probability was this outcome but i also wanted people to not lose trust in me villanova then won the game with a buzzer beater basket the game had an incredible finish said sabin and the espn prediction had been correct there s more to the story including a statistical twist and lessons learned so if you re affiliated with uci be sure to watch the recording with your ucnet id during the webinar sabin also talked about how it was sports that really generated my love of statistics in the first place and he explained how using sports analogies helped him make sense of difficult concepts in college when he couldn t grasp the idea of n dimensional space he thought of it in terms of having five different variables and trying to predict the outcome of a game it s easier to understand concepts if applied to a passion like sports he said which he views as opportunity for introducing new students to statistics i m a big believer that using sports can help increase diversity in stem education guindani similarly views sports as a potential recruitment tool it s an area that provides opportunities for getting students excited about statistics leveraging sports webinars for recruitmentsabin s talk was one of a series of webinars offered by the sport statistics group recordings of the other webinars are available online with your ucnet id career paths in statistics with luke bornn co founder and chief scientist of zelus analytics recording data and statistics in baseball what it s like to work in a baseball analytics department with kevin ferris of

earlier the next webinar will feature brendan kent of draftkings and creator the measurables educational sports analytics and sports tech podcast while a ucnet id is required to view recordings of previous events the live webinars are open to anyone from high school students exploring potential majors and career options to professional sports analysts or even international statisticians visit the events page for log in information however the long term goal of these webinars is to help recruit a dedicated group of uci students interested in working on a variety of projects related to sports stats the hope is that students after watching a webinar will get involved with the sport statistics uci group any uci students can join the group all ics students are welcome as well as students who might be majoring in a different field e g economics or psychology says guindani it would be awesome to put together a group that could eventually collaborate with uci s athletics

capstone course in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics was in 2009 with 19 students from the department of informatics working on five project teams now more than a decade later the informatics capstone course is offered three times a year and ics has added undergraduate capstone courses for its computer science and data science majors it also offers capstone courses through its master of human computer interaction and design mhcid master of computer science mcs and master of software engineering mswe professional programs even with the global pandemic moving people out of classrooms and offices and into online spaces this past year more than 130 ics capstone projects were successfully completed tremendous growth we re growing in leaps and bounds says informatics professor hadar ziv who led that first capstone course so many years ago this growth was on full display at the ics spring 2021 capstone student design showcase where nine of the 12 projects presented were a mere sampling of the more than 60 projects completed for the undergraduate informatics computer science and data science capstone programs this year you can view many of the student capstone videos online it was hard to select projects for the showcase because they all were very competitive says professor sergio gago masague who led the new computer science capstone and its 16 projects after a successful pilot version last year the course has already grown from 50 to 70 students and gago masague plans to scale it up again next year the capstone required for the data science major the first such undergraduate degree program offered in the uc system resulted in 14 projects created by 42 students this year the course is co taught by two faculty members each year one from the computer science department and one from the statistics department the balanced and rigorous curriculum of the data science major allows students to take on a wide range of ambitious capstone projects ranging from predicting medical treatment effects using electronic health records to using time series techniques to forecast product demand stresses statistics professor vladimir minin who directed the data science program the last three years starting july 1 2021 statistics professor mine dogucu will take the helm of the program the other three projects presented at the capstone student design showcase were award winning designs from the butterworth design competition a software development competition open to ics students the top prize and 10 000 was awarded to the grasshopper fund a startup marketplace and funding platform ics has also witnessed growth at the graduate level with the mcs spring 2021 capstone showcase featuring 18 different projects one of which armory took third place in the butterworth design competition mcs students working on the armory interactive platform which lets developers experiment with various cybersecurity threats so they can proactively write secure code were awarded 3 500 this year another seven projects were completed for the mhcid program and a joint mcs and mswe winter showcase in december presented 46 projects ten of which were created by the inaugural mswe cohort of 34 students quantity and qualitythe growing number of projects isn t the only impressive element of the ics capstone program the quality of the projects is also increasing says jason king associate director of corporate relations in ics we re seeing more success stories on both the student and sponsor side as we refine the capstone process and devote more time up front to setting up the projects this benefits the students faculty and corporate sponsors we re not just doing projects to do projects he says we re ensuring students gain the hands on experience and soft skills needed for future success ziv agrees a couple of my teams were not only the best in their class but among the best i ve taught in 12 years or so he said referring to the adventure biofeedback project where students created a game environment to make speech therapy for kids fun and the dreams for schools project where students helped a nonprofit stem education program scale up its operations the game environment for the adventure biofeedback project in developing the speech therapy application computer software engineering major eduardo magdaleno said it was an opportunity for him to apply all of my culminated skills that i learned during my four years at uci he was able to practice agile development project management hci and more while working closely with the stakeholders i did demos and user testing and learned that talking and eliciting the right questions was very important so our application could be built with the users in mind informatics major stella adriana who helped design an instructor assignment sorter for dreams for schools similarly talked during the showcase about how the project helped her learn how to effectively communicate with developers google software engineer tim laubach one of more than 120 participants at the online capstone student design showcase stressed the importance of the students learning this lesson the most beautiful design in the world if it can t be implemented doesn t help the user gaining this practical hands one experience is what the capstone courses are all about there are things we just can t teach in a traditional classroom the capstone course gives students a leg up as they transition out of their undergraduate degree and into their careers says informatics lecturer matthew bietz who taught one of the capstone courses this year even those who already have a background in industry have a lot to gain from the capstone experience working on this project has expanded my knowledge of agile development and working on a team which will be significant in my career progression says mcs student uddeshya kumar who worked on an artistic photos application to help people create art from photos this project gave me the opportunity to learn new technologies that align with my professional goals and will prove to be crucial in the near future a presentation of the artistic photos application the project sponsors are yet another beneficiary of the capstone courses project sponsors tell me again and again how happy they are to have worked with the students says bietz some sponsors come from nonprofits and just this quarter our students built apps to help victims of trafficking to support parents of children with developmental disabilities and to help cancer patients better understand their treatment using 3d visualization to name just a few he says some sponsors join us from startups or larger tech companies and in addition to creating marketable products working with the students is a way to identify individuals they want to recruit this form of networking is invaluable to students and sponsors alike for all of the skill building and new knowledge the students get says bietz the real impacts of the capstone program lie in building relationships careers and passions if you are a company interested in sponsoring an undergraduate or

second ever virtual ceremony nevertheless represented something extraordinary the class of 2021 will have a unique place in our institutional memory as the most resilient and responsive class we have ever had the privilege of teaching said chancellor howard gillman during his opening remarks under the most extraordinary circumstances you rose to the occasion supported each other adapted and persisted as gillman lamented the physical separation of the occasion instead of the traditional gathering in the bren center he emphasized that no matter our physical circumstances we are right now anteaters together marking this great moment in your life graduates of the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics heard a similar sentiment from dean marios c papaefthymiou in his welcome for the ics ceremony ics expects to confer more than 1 200 undergraduate and 100 graduate degrees this year although the hybrid nature of this commencement is not as gratifying as an in person live ceremony the significance of the event remains as strong as ever said papaefthymiou as the class of 2021 transitioned from students to graduates joining a network of more than 10 000 ics alumni papaefthymiou spoke of their larger role in society our aspiration is that you re graduating from our program equipped to make a positive impact on our world using technology to do good and leading in creating a better future for everyone four student commencement speakers then recalled their anteater journeys starting with tiffany kong although kong has already secured a position as an engineer at qualcomm she admitted that she had no intention of graduating with a bachelor s degree in computer science when she first came to uci i never really thought about working in the tech or software industry let alone majoring in computer science but i did know three things i enjoyed math i enjoyed art and i really wanted to attend uci she told her fellow classmates through computer science i came to enjoy a variety of topics such as ai and hci because they provide a perfect blend between art and design and math and technology she spoke of both the devastation she felt after failing ics 32 as well as the courage she mustered to successfully retake the course for me failing a class seemed like a nightmare or even now for us graduating into a pandemic it s hard to get out of that doomsday mindset she said however this is what has made us stronger all these challenges that we have gone through have proven to us that we have never let doubt consume us similar to kong software engineering graduate jennifer kwon also found her passion at uci after taking a project management course my time at uci has brought me invaluable skills and i couldn t have asked for a better experience here she said she was driven to succeed taking courses over summer to continue her learning her senior capstone class provided one of her most memorable experiences as she conducted a research study in collaboration with the children s hospital of orange county to make speech therapy fun for kids the project was recently highlighted during the ics spring 2021 capstone student design showcase kwon had this advice for her classmates class of 2021 be fearless kind and optimistic anteaters computer science and engineering graduate ming hua lawrence spoke of the tremendous challenges he faced in his journey to this moment born with autism i m so grateful today to receive my bachelor s degree after studying for five and a half years he said noting that learning algorithms and programming c and systemverilog was especially difficult for him requiring more than twice the time needed for other students yet he persevered i truly feel that any goal is possible if we put our mind heart and soul into it he told his classmates my biggest wish today is to encourage you whether autistic or not to always have hope kindness and perseverance so the highest purpose can be reached first generation low income latino student francisco loya spoke of the resilience of this class of 2021 in particular a bird sitting in a tree is never afraid of the branch breaking because her trust is not in the branch but in her own wings said the computer science graduate the students who have gone through uci before us have passed tough classes met great people and graduated each and every one of us has done the same but have done so while assisting sick family members getting internships and job offers rescinded and fighting for equality he noted so yes we are now graduating with a degree but the strongest asset we ve proven that we have is grit and a strong work ethic the class of 2021 is indeed unique in having overcome the yearlong upheaval caused by the global pandemic each graduating student whose name was read with pomp and circumstance playing in the background as their slide flashed on the screen has their own story of overcoming challenges in earning their ics degree particularly during their final year in the program yet each and every one showed great determination in reaching this moment and will forever share a special place in history as that most resilient

been known for its impressive machine learning repository with more than 580 publicly accessible datasets the repository serves as a tremendous resource for empirical and methodological research in machine learning it also serves as a great learning tool for uci students thanks to the second annual ml hackathon a student competition funded by the national science foundation the uci research community donated nine challenge datasets from the repository for the event and the research cyberinfrastructure center rcic provided the computational resources we wanted to create a fun opportunity for students to engage with real projects within the uci research community says tamanna hossain a graduate student in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics who organized this year s hackathon my favorite part of the event was definitely the enthusiasm and curiosity students brought to the table especially under the difficult conditions of the ongoing covid 19 pandemic ten teams participated in the virtual hackathon held may 14 through may 23 2021 and competed for the top prize of 500 for best overall and for four 250 prizes awarded for technical skills scientific insights creativity and best presentation yu miyauchi award winning hacksthe top prize went to hatomugi an ml model designed to detect fake reviews on yelp developed by data science major yu miyauchi the model leveraged the yelpnyc challenge dataset which contains 359 052 yelp reviews for restaurants in new york city miyauchi who graduated in june and is now a data analysis consultant at deloitte says this competition was a great way to simulate my future work yu miyauchi explaining his machine learning model for fake review detection in yelp qingchuan yang yihan wang another hack using the yelpnyc data was aces2alliance which won the technical skills award data science major yihan wang and computer science major qingchuan yang applied deep learning algorithms to predict whether an unlabeled yelp review was real or fake i was not expecting to win the award at the end says wang but i am grateful to ics for giving the current students a platform to showcase the skills we have learned yang added that it was exciting to apply ml theories learned from lectures to practice and see how powerful they are andrew chen the award for scientific insights went to i am a segmentation fault developed by computer science major andrew chen using the dataset containing climate change and ecosystem carbon information in california i created a regressor that predicts carbon densities in california based on projected temperature and precipitation conditions he says this event was a great opportunity to use the theoretical machine learning skills that we heard about in class on real world data sets richard lopez and rionel dmello the most creative hack was two truths and a lie developed by computer science majors rionel dmello and richard lopez given a misconception and tweet pair our goal was to detect if that tweet propagates the misconception allowing content moderation on social media the students used the covidlies dataset of approximately 6 000 tweet and misconception pairs and fasttext a shallow neural network to extract word embeddings i enjoyed working on a project that was so closely related to the pandemic and i understand the challenges that big tech faces in regard to reducing the spread of misinformation says dmello my partner and i also had to come up with innovative ways to communicate and share information over various platforms which was a challenge in itself lopez agrees working on a covid related project in the middle of the pandemic was quite an adventure randy huynh top left ruslan manahoran top right and william hou another hack using the covidlies dataset was wtawtaw which won the presentation award for this hack first year computer science students randy huynh and ruslan manahoran along with first year data science student william hou focused on characterizing common covid 19 misconceptions and developing a model to detect their presence covid 19 has had such a huge impact on our lives and all around the world and it was really interesting to explore how rampant covid 19 misinformation is on the internet says the teammates through our research we were able to determine commonalities between misinformative tweets such as word and phrase choice types of misinformation certain themes etc we hope our project will contribute to the development of more robust misinformation detection models in the future advancing ml researchin addition to the competition the event included ml research talks by computer science professor sameer singh and computer science ph d students sam showalter anthony chen dylan slack and gavin kerrigan singh chancellor s professor padhraic smyth and rcic director philip papadopoulos served as faculty mentors throughout the event and because all of the projects completed were open source the hackathon work contributed to ml research as well this is an amazing opportunity for undergraduates not only to gain hands on experience with applying machine learning to real problems which can really help them get jobs in machine learning but further working on scientific problems offered by uci faculty means that the undergraduates are helping advanced research i wish i had such opportunities as an undergrad says singh it is also a great opportunity for the faculty across campus to use our excellent ics undergraduates to prototype what applying ml to their projects would look

participated in the online event she was unaware that a clock and tribute book were hidden behind a chair in her home office she learned of the items only after the consortium for the advancement of undergraduate statistics education cause announced her as the recipient of the 2021 george cobb lifetime achievement award in statistics education the award is presented biennially at uscots to an individual who has made lasting contributions with a broad impact and as outlined in her nomination letter jessica s work in the statistics education community is second to none utts has authored two bestselling textbooks for introductory statistics seeing through statistics first published in 1996 and now in its fourth edition and mind on statistics with robert heckard first published in 2001 and is now in its sixth edition she has held leadership roles that influence both collegiate and high school curriculum and has been a passionate advocate for statistical literacy for all publishing papers that outline what educated citizens should know about statistics even in retirement she continues to be in demand as a speaker with her most recent theme being data science ethics i was of course honored to find out that i had won but the most astounding part was the collection of letters that comprised the nomination packet and the assortment of photos testimonials and memories in the tribute book says utts i will be forever grateful to the nominators for the work they did in creating those documents and amazed that i didn t find out they were doing it jessica utts finds the clock hidden in her home after learning she had won the george cobb lifetime achievement award in statistics education according to the written testimonials utts has changed the face of statistics education and is internationally respected forward thinking visionary one person spoke of her influence on k 12 and collegiate education in the united states while another noted that as the first female statistician i had ever met you have been a role model for me yet another summarized her work as follows over the past forty years you have demonstrated excellence in teaching a variety of forward looking statistics courses innovated in creative ways published a number of foundational articles and textbooks that continue to shape the field and engaged in professional service to help foment change as the nominating letter concludes we marvel at what she has accomplished and she has done it all with humor grace and an enthusiasm that is contagious the dinsdale awardone month after receiving the george cobb award on july 27 2021 utts received the dinsdale award from the society for scientific exploration sse she learned of the honor at sse pa connections 2021 a joint online conference between the sse and the parapsychological association pa established in 1992 the award named after tim dinsdale recognizes significant contributions to the expansion of human understanding through the study of unexplained phenomena it aims to reward senior scholars who have significantly contributed to our understanding of anomalous physical biological and psychological events in the spirit of meticulous research exemplary methodology and proper scholarly attitude utts received the award for significant contributions in the rigorous application of statistical methods to the study of psi shorthand for parapsychology including remote perception presentiment and distant healing i was delighted to have my work recognized by receiving the dinsdale award and was particularly pleased that the awardee immediately preceding me was hal puthoff who first introduced me to this research area says utts who met puthoff many years ago at an see conference puthoff was the director of the government funded research program studying psychic abilities and their possible use for intelligence gathering he was looking for a statistical consultant for a program based out of sri international utts became a consultant for the program and still collaborates with parapsychology researchers to this day about half of my research publications are related to my work in parapsychology she says noting that her most prominent work was a report she put together for congress my work was a part of the full report evaluating the government work on psychic abilities commonly referred to by one of its code names stargate she says that report led to appearances on cnn larry king live and lots of other media outlets the dinsdale award appropriately spotlights how utts leveraged her ph d work in statistics and her undergraduate study of both math and psychology to push the boundaries of mainstream science and advance the field of parapsychology all while continuing to advance statistics

professional goals december 8 2021 women have been historically underrepresented in stem and that trend continues today the pew research center found that women make up 25 of computing occupations and girls make up approximately 30 of ap computer science test takers girls and women face a number of challenges in the stem field which is why uci s master of data science program aims to make stem more accessible to underrepresented groups our goal is to diversify the field of data science and break the mold we want to increase female representation in tech and also help improve social mobility for underrepresented groups in the u s mds program manager bryan mu oz said the mds program launched in fall 2021 welcomed 25 students in its inaugural class of 2022 thirty two percent of the first mds cohort are women one of them being adelynn paik who serves as one of five mds program ambassadors as ambassadors we act as representatives of the program to prospective students and potential company partners paik said we are also the first point of contact for many applicants so i hope to be a welcoming face for all to prospective mds program female candidates seeing how women like paik can thrive in computing fields is inspirational because they see how they too belong in stem having leaders and programs that strive to make stem more inclusive also helps change discriminatory attitudes that women often endure from not being taken seriously to experiencing sexist policies my challenges as a woman in stem started with two discrediting high school math teachers and have taken a number of different forms since then paik said i think the worst part is when the misogyny cannibalizes your mind and you start to make yourself small even without a perpetrator it takes work to choose not to be bitter or afraid some days more than others and to re center yourself in your own path in her position as an mds program ambassador paik hopes to contribute to the efforts to make the sciences more welcoming and supportive of women i can be part of the normalization of women excelling in this program especially in its infancy she said alongside making data science less unfamiliar to potential female students another goal that paik wants to achieve in the mds program is expanding her knowledge of data science while developing a burgeoning focus on one specific field paik s interest in data science comes from her longtime passion for stem particularly math and her undergraduate education at the massachusetts institute of technology mit she majored in systems engineering within mit s civil engineering department and received her degree in 2021 paik was also involved in two research groups at mit work of the future and glaciers group the first was the work of the future task force which was an interdisciplinary effort to analyze the impact of increasing automation on future jobs my mentor and i investigated automotive startup activity by collecting both qualitative and quantitative data paik said i was also briefly part of the glaciers group where i used computer vision to track the longitudinal movement of a glacier front as someone who decided to study systems engineering because she wanted to learn about how people move and live paik said the research she conducted at mit reflects her interests in the realms of city development transportation planning and the environment she added that her systems engineering education at mit which was rooted in mathematical and technical material translates well to her current graduate school education data science seems like the swiss army knife of majors in its applicability across fields i cannot think of an industry that doesn t make use of data in some way paik said at uci s mds program i m gaining useful skills while giving myself the chance to learn about the job landscape through offerings such as career counseling and the capstone project when paik isn t playing around with numbers you can find her taking classes on improv at the groundlings theatre school where she s a two time diversity scholarship recipient or doing stand up comedy i love that communal feeling of being in a cramped dimly lit room telling jokes to an audience and hanging out with other comedians as an asian american woman i find it s a great exercise in taking up space and defying the label that we are subservient she said what marries together the realms of comedy and stem for paik are how they empower women of color to be loud and let our talents represent us the optimism initiative and passion that paik has in her academics hobbies and beyond are sure to help her achieve her goals in the mds program in the short term i look forward to claiming a specialty within data science and starting a career in the environmental transportation healthcare or entertainment industry paik said my long term goal is to remain hopeful and work on projects with people i respect and admire karen phan disney

news seminar center for statistical consulting tech trends for 2022 january 10 2022 ics professors daniel epstein mohsen imani and tianchen qian discuss their research and the technological developments they expect in the coming year the new year starts with healthcare front and center as covid 19 continues to impact people s daily lives throughout the pandemic the fields of computer science informatics and statistics have all played an important role in helping people move their lives online stay connected and analyze vast amounts of data for informed decision making how will these fields continue to advance virtual and augmented spaces find new ways to bring people together and improve healthcare analytics and interventions in the coming year here to answer these questions while covering an array of topics including artificial intelligence ai wearables the aging population mental health and cybersecurity are three professors from the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics daniel epstein assistant professor of informatics and leader of the personal informatics everyday pie lab studies personal tracking technology and designs devices and apps that help people better track everything from health and fitness to finances and productivity mohsen imani assistant professor of computer science is working on a wide range of practical problems in the area of bio inspired computing machine learning computer architecture and embedded systems tianchen qian assistant professor of statistics works to develop methodology to understand causal relationships through the analysis of highly complex data with applications focusing on health and wearable technology the unique structure of ics as a standalone school with three departments computer science informatics and statistics makes it the perfect environment for exploring all aspects of computing and technology and the impact on society let s see what technological developments these three scholars expect to see in 2022 what technology advances are you most excited about as we head into 2022 daniel epstein epstein far from my area of expertise augmented reality has only recently become viable on people s everyday phones while i m skeptical that it will revolutionize the way we communicate with one another i m hopeful that it will help us create richer experiences once we find the right niches where the technology is really valuable i m also excited to hopefully see us take all of the big advances in conversational agents into important areas where people find them useful current research says they re mainly just used for setting timers and playing music my student lucas silva has been examining how voice assistants can make food journaling less burdensome and fit in with everyday technology use like using an alexa instead of your phone to log what you just ate while your hands are busy doing the dishes mohsen imani imani this pandemic has proven that virtual reality vr is an essential technology for our future communication vr will make significant changes in how we communicate with computers and each other it will shorten physical boundaries by giving us virtual feelings besides vr i am also excited to see the next generation of wearable devices and health monitoring technologies that could change the quality of healthcare systems tianchen qian qian i m most excited about the advances in wearable device and sensor technology and in particular their increasing applications in healthcare with these technology we are getting better at detecting the state of an individual such as stress level and location and potentially delivering behavior change interventions to them in real time this provides ample opportunity to improve health but also brings a lot of challenges such as how to balance the therapeutic effect of the interventions and the burden of receiving interventions through smartphone and wearable devices what is the next big challenge you think society will face and how will your field help epstein covid 19 forced us to radically restructure how we live and work with one another while there is certainly some appetite to return to normal for many people normal was worse or wasn t good either i think the big challenge for society is thinking through what changes for the better emerged from our situation and how do we not lose those in a foolhardy attempt to wipe the memory of the pandemic from the vantage point of informatics i particularly see us helping out in understanding how technology helped move activities that were in person to online and advocating for the things that became better from being online everything from online education to telemedicine to how people socialize with one another imani we face increasing needs for efficient and real time processing for diverse cognitive tasks using a vast volume of generated data deep learning and ai are predicted to make evolutionary changes in many areas including healthcare finance and cybersecurity to extract useful information applications often rely on sophisticated and costly machine learning and ai algorithms that lack transparency robustness and have long latency and high power consumption for realistic intelligent and effective systems to be developed and deployed there are crucial needs for scalable learning and computing methods on embedded devices for example algorithms that now run on large scale data centers with kilowatt power consumption need to be processed in real time on our daily used smart devices for example a smartwatch and smart glass this requires fundamental changes on the algorithm and underlying hardware qian the current one is obviously the pandemic which my colleagues have thoughtfully commented on the next big challenge in my view is the aging population and how to improve the quality of life for the elderly with longer life expectancy and lower birth rate the composition of the age pyramid is transitioning toward an older population and there are many challenges ahead how would the society take care of the elderly when a large proportion of the society are themselves old how can we empower the elderly with modern technology so that they can enjoy their lives without the assistance of another human for a longer period of time how can their quality of life be further improved while respecting the inevitable decline in physical and mental capabilities my collaborators from uci mind and i are investigating the early signs for alzheimer s disease and other cognitive disorders we are looking at the data from uci s 90 study where hundreds of individuals over 90 years old have been followed for years and have has their cognitive performance assessed over time we hope to identify features that can be used to predict cognitive disorders and bring new insights into the process everyone will face aging how is your field affecting people s day to day lives epstein in my mind informatics is at the forefront of taking technology advances and seriously thinking about how they can should and even shouldn t impact people s everyday lives in my specific area of personal health we re understanding how people feel about the well being technology they use every day and are testing out new ideas for improving those technologies based on research we ve seen health apps like apple health move from showing people pretty boring bar graphs of how much they walk each day to more useful insights and trends we ve also seen apps improve since earlier work in 2017 how they support people of more varied identities and goals such as menstrual health apps better supporting transgender and non binary individuals and all people across their health lifecycle some changes might feel subtle but they go a long way toward helping people get the health support they need from technology imani my research on hyperdimensional computing hdc aims to redesign algorithms using strategies that more closely model the human brain this new direction is an alternative paradigm that mimics important brain functionalities toward high efficiency and noise tolerant computation hdc is motivated by the observation that the human brain operates on high dimensional data representations hdc incorporates learning capability along with typical memory functions of storing loading information hdc has shown several advantages as the next generation of cognitive machines to enable human like intelligence first instead of requiring many iterations and data points for training hdc can learn in a single iteration from just a few examples second hdc operations are highly parallel and lightweight thus empowering online learning on our daily used smart devices finally hdc has a natural robustness to noise which is essential for current unreliable network and hardware technologies qian i would like to talk about the elephant in the room which is having a huge impact on people s day to day lives right now the covid 19 pandemic statistics has played an important role in our society s joint effort to combat covid 19 enabling us to efficiently and appropriately use data to make informed decisions it has helped us monitor cases model disease spread develop vaccines and assess their effectiveness establish guidelines on dosage and boosters and predict the future trajectory of the pandemic to guide policymaking what industry will experience the most changes based on computing advances in the next five years epstein like every year recently the question is which industries won t be heavily impacted by computing advances closest to my work i m expecting we ll reach an inflection point where healthcare takes more seriously what patients are experiencing outside of their clinical visits we re already seeing telehealth and messaging a doctor systems being widely available and used but i think we ll start seeing these systems extended to include more options for care for example at home covid tests have become big and i wouldn t be surprised to see those sorts of records be better digitized and structured to support population health but i also expect other industries will be seriously changed too imani there is no doubt that all industries will experience major changes using emerging ai techniques but i will highlight two in particular healthcare and cybersecurity ai powered health monitoring technology can help doctors prioritize patients and provide urgent care to those in the most danger thereby saving lives in addition such technology for example in the form of a lightweight wearable device like a bracelet also offers a convenient method for patients to monitor their own health ai technologies are also stepping in to help improve cyber resilience as security issues have started presenting a day to day struggle for businesses attackers are getting smarter so our cybersecurity must grow smarter too it is essential to deploy effective cybersecurity technology based on future machine learning algorithms with higher intelligence efficiency and human like reasoning capability qian i think one of them would be healthcare our healthcare model is transitioning from episodic event based care to integrated preventative and holistic care the advances in computation and ai are among the key facilitators for this transition with the rapid advances in wearable technology more and more people will be able to get care when and where they need it the most and i m not just talking about physical health mental health is an equally important aspect and its care stands to be greatly transformed by technology advances imagine someone who is trying to quit smoking wearable sensors nowadays allow us to use prediction algorithms to detect in real time when a user is stressed a big risk factor for relapse in smokers furthermore we now have the capability to immediately act on this real time prediction through digital interventions delivered through the wearable device or a smartphone such as recommending a mindfulness exercise to the individual to help reduce their stress level all these can be done without the involvement of another human being these type of smartphone and wearable based health interventions are also being developed in various other domains such as physical activity bipolar disorder substance abuse and so on i can only imagine how many more there will be in the next five years to transform healthcare and people s well being what research projects will you be focused on in the coming year epstein together with my students i m focused on moving people s health tracking practices beyond individual apps or experiences and into the complex circumstances where people use technology for example supported by an icts pilot award my student eunkyung jo is planning to bridge the gap between health data that patients collect and how doctors use that data we re planning to develop ways to annotate health questionnaires that your doctor might give you to fill out at home like symptom logs with your own data two of my other students dennis wang and xi lu are looking at what role social media should play in helping people get support and advice around the health data they collect and understanding why apps like myfitnesspal and weight watchers don t seem to be enough to serve those goals supported by snap research we ve been working on using data to help people who are meditating together become more aware of each other s mental states imani we aim to explore alternative computational models that enable further energy scaling by abandoning the deterministic requirement of today s computing systems these approaches will be particularly effective in the realization of cognitive functions such as recognition decision making and learning these functions are gaining rapid importance in a world that is infused with sensing modalities and in need of efficient information extraction qian my research focuses on the experimental design and statistical methods for developing mobile health interventions in particular i aim to develop efficient methods to utilize wearable data in order to answer the question of when where and under what context should a mobile health intervention be delivered one of the projects i will be focusing on in the coming year is a collaboration with professor pathik wadhwa from the uci school of medicine and other colleagues where we aim to develop just in time adaptive interventions for reducing stress among pregnant women and women of childbearing age this project involves building a prediction algorithm for detecting real time stress designing a micro randomized trial to collect data and constructing the algorithm to deliver the interventions in an optimal way on a more personal note what is your new year s resolution and is there anything from your bucket list you hope to cross off in 2022 epstein yikes big question i picked back up trail running this fall and did a few races for the first time in a while so my big goal there is to stick with staying active imani after two years of pandemic and remote working i believe it is finally the time to explore the world i am so excited to use summertime to travel with my family as helen keller once said life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all qian i just had a newborn in the summer of 2021 one of my new year s resolutions is to spend more time with my son and my family to cherish the moments when he is so little and so adorable

list of resources including on campus groups here at uci we also list some nationwide organizations and books that focus on diversity and race in technology as well as spotlight some black leaders in computer science and engineering both on and off campus when we think about black history month we usually begin by acknowledging those who have come before us and who are often overlooked in our society says gregory diggs yang assistant director of the stacey nicholas office of access and inclusion oai we should always honor those trailblazers but we should also recognize those great contributors who are currently widening the trail and those who are just beginning down it created in 2014 oai is a joint office between ics and the henry samueli school of engineering focused on recruiting retaining and graduating talented students from historically excluded populations the following is not meant to be an exhaustive list stresses diggs yang but rather a starting point for reflection during black history month and a way to recognize current black visionaries and new pioneers i am excited to be acknowledging the current unsung heroes of black history as it is being made creating a supportive campus culturewe start with a list of organizations at uci that are focused on supporting the black community the black faculty staff association bfsa provides a sense of purpose for african american faculty and staff by creating a presence on campus that is visible supportive nurturing and productive in serving the needs of the african american community sign up for the bfsa list serve the black graduate student network bgsn provides an encouraging inclusive social networking community for african american graduate and professional students at uci the organization s goals

engineering and in the information and computer sciences in the samueli school of engineering assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering tayloria adams studies the physical properties of stem cell and cancer cell populations using innovative microfluidic devices her projects use electric currents and cell motion to develop membrane capacitance and other measurable cellular properties as reliable label free biological markers she holds a patent for her discoveries and was a national science foundation nsf postdoctoral fellow and uci chancellor s advance postdoctoral fellow adams recently earned a prestigious nsf career award and an award from the university of california cancer research coordinating committee also she is working with a multidisciplinary team to develop a curriculum focused on the meaningful engagement of minoritized students in the classroom this nsf funded grant led by pheather r harris director of uci s california alliance for minority participation is cutting edge and explores the environmental factors causing minoritized students to leave stem adams is also highly engaged in activities to increase the number of black high school undergraduate and graduate students pursuing stem fields black history month is very important to me says adams it s a chance for reflection on the strength of my ancestors which i channel into my research teaching and service i strive to be my ancestors wildest dreams and to influence the next generation of black engineers also in the samueli school of engineering assistant professor of biomedical engineering timothy downing is leading a team of interdisciplinary researchers working to uncover the molecular and physical principles of epigenome replication the project is funded through a 3 million nsf grant for research that seeks to better understand the dynamic nature of the epigenome which will open new possibilities for cellular engineering the award will also support activities that broaden participation in science among high schoolers and undergraduates including students from underrepresented groups in addition downing received 2 million in funding for a 2019 new innovator award with this work he aims to shed light on how mechanical cues integrate with and give rise to disease driving epigenetic mutations ultimately leading to the discovery of better treatment options for cancer patients black history month is a great opportunity for us all to reflect and remember to bring our full self into the edges of the social networks that we live and work in says downing it represents the idea that there s space in our society for everyone to exist and participate authentically when we do that incredible things happen in the school of ics assistant professor of informatics roderic crooks studies the intersections of race technology and public life his current project explores how community organizers in working class communities of color use data for activist projects even as they dispute the proliferation of data intensive technologies in education law enforcement financial services and other vital sites of civic concern the pursuit of science including information and computer sciences does not exempt anyone from participation in the complex dynamics and shared histories of anti black racism in the united states and across the world says crooks we are all deeply enmeshed in systems of power and privilege that benefit some and harm others based on interlocking hierarchies of citizenship wealth race class gender sexuality and disability i am encouraged by the increased willingness of our students to name these dynamics and to consider the study of structural oppression central to the work we do in ics also in the school of ics is ian harris who has been a professor in the department of computer science since 2004 his research interests include the design of secure hardware and software systems and the application of natural language understanding to security and design his current projects include the detection of phone based social engineering attacks the formalization of natural language specifications and the development of a cyber test range to evaluate the security of iot systems he is also leading a team of students participating in the mitre embedded capture the flag competition joni ricks oddie is the first full time director of the uci center for statistical consulting and is also director of the institute for clinical and translational sciences icts biostatistics epidemiology and research design berd unit by managing both ricks oddie who earned her ph d in epidemiology from ucla in 2012 has streamlined processes so the two groups operate in sync as a one stop shop for the uci community and affiliated organizations needing to collaborate with a statistician she works with a variety of organizations including chapman university and children s hospital of orange county and has organized many training sessions and workshops at uci she has a heart for working on diversity equity and inclusion dei related projects and is currently helping to lead the icts black thriving initiative strategic plan as well as working with faculty in the statistics department to expose underrepresented minority urm middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science every few decades our nation has a crisis of conscience as it pertains to its black citizenry says ricks oddie we change policies enact new laws develop diversity initiatives and commit to do better unfortunately each time the situation or crisis that initiated the movement ultimately gets forgotten and society moves on to some other more fashionable issue i truly hope this time we do not get weary in well doing and are able to sustain our commitment to making uci a place where black people are truly able to thrive and be their authentic selves shani murray 4 ics professors among 7 uci

endeavor that marries uci s powerhouse health sciences engineering machine learning artificial intelligence clinical genomics and data science capabilities to deliver the most effective health and wellness strategy for each individual person and in doing so confronts the linked challenges of health equity and the high cost of care the institute will bring a multifaceted integrated approach to what many call the next great advancement in healthcare precision medicine collects patient data history exams demographics molecular and diagnostic tests and uses the power of computer algorithms predictive modeling and ai to develop personalized treatment and lifelong health maintenance plans what we re doing at the institute for precision health is perhaps the most important step we ll take in this generation to improve health and well being said steve a n goldstein m d ph d faap uci s vice chancellor for health affairs the ever evolving capabilities of the iph herald a future of personally tailored care that fundamentally alters the healthcare landscape to place the patient at the center and in control in the past individuals were treated based on approaches thought to be best for groups of patients now we begin the iph epoch of patient centric care designed to continuously improve the health of the individual within their community even as new knowledge accrues whereby rights incentives transparency and control remain the purview of the patient goldstein added iph is an ecosystem for collaboration across disciplines that comprises seven areas smart statistics machine learning artificial intelligence designs software to integrate and analyze health records molecular data and observations the unit is led by daniel gillen professor and chair of statistics and zhaoxia yu associate professor of statistics a2ir applied artificial intelligence research designs practical solutions to real world clinical problems for cost effective value based care it is led by dr peter chang assistant professor of radiological sciences a3 applied analytics and artificial intelligence brings solutions to inpatient ambulatory and community settings and

by suzanne sandmeyer professor of biological chemistry and leslie thompson donald bren professor of psychiatry human behavior and neurobiology behavior collaboratory for health and wellness powered by syntropy houses the dynamic analytics platforms and patient controlled data at the core of the iph ecosystem the group is led by tom andriola vice chancellor for information technology and data and kai zheng professor of informatics deployable health equity employs machine learning artificial intelligence into communities to create solutions narrowing the disparities gap in the health and well being of vulnerable populations the unit is led by dr dan cooper professor of pediatrics and associate vice chancellor for clinical translational research and bernadette boden albala professor and director of the program in public health and founding dean of the planned school of population public health education and training with leadership from each area brings courses seminars certificates and degrees in statistics machine learning artificial intelligence omics and bioinformatics to practitioners and students because the disciplines included in iph already existed at uci goldstein noted it was in many ways only a small step to join them together and build a resource across campus the synergy created however is no small matter this is the giant leap for healthcare it s glaringly clear that precision health is how to increase the quality of care to decrease the cost of care by both improving how it s delivered and matching cost to value and to deliver quality healthcare to the underserved he said adding that the institute s success will be measured by improvements in individual and community health a major goal is revealing new approaches to tackle ailments that lack successful therapies for many diseases especially neurodegenerative ones like alzheimer s parkinson s and even huntington s where the causal gene is known there are simply no treatments available that change their course we re excited because we know that with precision health we have the potential to define diseases better understand them better and treat them far better said thompson iph co director we expect major breakthroughs while the vision idea for iph has long been in the works the covid 19 pandemic was a beta test demonstrating how rapidly critical medical needs could be addressed in early 2020 with elements of iph in place uci clinicians biomedical and computer scientists and public health experts joined forces to create an ai driven tool to assess the critical care needs of covid patients this app based tool the covid vulnerability index demonstrated that a data driven approach coupled with world class clinical therapeutics could help yield the best outcomes for individuals we couldn t have had a proof of concept with higher stakes than the pandemic said tom andriola iph co director we saw in real time how mobilizing our capabilities to analyze health data and make customized decisions could complement leading edge clinical treatments to save lives and reduce hospital stays additionally there is an explosion of data in healthcare and we re still only using a small fraction in decision making he added iph is including not only data from traditional healthcare settings but also the data coming from a new generation of empowered health consumers who are tracking and managing their own health journey the plan is for iph to have a brick and mortar home on the uci campus that will serve as a hub for educating data informed clinicians to practice at the top of their licenses a site for the infrastructure to facilitate translational research a place for community outreach and a venue for commercial collaborations already industry leaders such as syntropy and mitre and community partners such as children s health of orange county and the va long beach healthcare system are working with iph to leverage uci s capabilities and commitment as a fair broker for health data placing individuals first for patients the message is that uci s institute for precision health is the future of your care and well being goldstein said for the research community iph is a wide open opportunity for discoveries that matter for the business community iph is ready to partner to advance new cost effective care and for the philanthropic community the folks

with videos now making up more than 80 of all consumer internet traffic even the smallest improvements in compression algorithms can dramatically impact our ability to store and share information it has been speculated for a long time that neural networks will ultimately revolutionize data compression technologies recently such attempts have proved successful says stephan mandt an assistant professor of computer science and statistics in uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics mandt has been at the forefront of this work our group at uci has been pioneering research into using neural networks to compress data funding from an nsf career award and other nsf grants has supported this work to make their research more accessible the group recently published a survey titled an introduction to neural data compression currently undergoing peer review in april 2022 mandt and his collaborators will present two scientific papers at the international conference on learning representations iclr 2022 a globally renowned conference on cutting edge research in deep learning their first paper advances solutions to a fundamental problem in information theory while the second introduces a new model for general purpose lossless data compression understanding compression feasibilityin towards empirical sandwich bounds on the rate distortion function mandt and his ph d student yibo yang quantify the fundamental hardness of compressing real world data such as images if you ve ever paid attention to the file size of jpeg images you may notice how certain kinds of images take up more storage than others of the same dimensions explains yang it turns out that with information theory we can quantify the inherent compressibility of a given type of data using a quantity called the rate distortion function and no data compression algorithm can beat the theoretical performance limit implied by it therefore knowing the rate distortion function of the data being compressed can really help researchers assess and improve their compression algorithms although the rate distortion function can be worked out mathematically for a few simple data distributions establishing it for other data in general especially for big data of practical interest has been an open research problem with this work yang and mandt move closer to this goal by developing a machine learning algorithm that can estimate the rate distortion function of potentially high dimensional types of data such as images and voice recordings it was really exciting to see the algorithm i sketched out on paper actually work on real world data ranging from natural images and speech spectrograms to data from particle physics says yang such data would have posed an insurmountable computation challenge to the previously known method an algorithm from the 1970s still the general problem is not quite solved and i hope this work opens up new possibilities for future research toward lossless compression with machine learningin hbo s television series silicon valley a group of hackers develops a fundamentally new lossless compression algorithm it turns out that fiction is not too far from reality in a recent collaboration involving anji liu a ph d student at ucla and liu s advisor computer science professor guy van den broeck mandt contributed to a new general purpose compression approach lossless compression with probabilistic circuits published as a spotlight at iclr 2022 the idea of lossless compression is very similar to that of morse code where we abbreviate frequent letters like e by a single dit and rare letters by three dits this leads to an optimally short representation of the message says mandt the key to lossless compression is hence to reliably predict how frequently any given symbol occurs for simple data we can just count but for more complicated data like images we need predictive machine learning models while most neural compression employs popular deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks the present work uses a fundamentally different niche machine learning approach called probabilistic circuits pcs with the help of these models the researchers could dramatically accelerate relevant computations that play a key role in data compression as a result their pc based de compression algorithm runs 5 20 times faster than neural compression algorithms that achieve similar bitrates this work says mandt is a great example of how curiosity driven fundamental research can culminate in surprising

researchers had developed a hybrid human machine framework for ai systems that can complement human expertise from chatbots that answer tax questions to algorithms that drive autonomous vehicles and dish out medical diagnoses artificial intelligence undergirds many aspects of daily life creating smarter more accurate systems requires a hybrid human machine approach according to researchers at the university of california irvine in a study published this month in proceedings of the national academy of sciences they present a new mathematical model that can improve performance by combining human and algorithmic predictions and confidence scores the seeds for this cutting edge work by researchers in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics and the school of social sciences were first planted decades ago this collaboration started with padhraic smyth chancellor s professor in the computer science and statistics departments and mark steyvers a professor in the department of cognitive sciences padhraic smyth left and mark steyvers stand outside of donald bren hall steve zylius uci one of the really nice things about uci is that there s a lot of interdisciplinary activity says smyth whose research is supported through a qualcomm faculty award there is this culture of collaboration so cognitive scientists come to bren hall to attend our ai and machine learning talks and we go to their talks in fact smyth and steyvers have been meeting periodically since the early 2000s we d chat over coffee about our projects says smyth we speak different languages but we re both interested in intelligence just from different perspectives computer science emphasizes artificial and cognitive sciences emphasizes natural and there s a lot of overlap so when the national science foundation nsf put out a call for research related to how humans and ai work together smyth and steyvers put together two proposals both of which were funded in 2019 one grant focuses on hybrid human algorithm predictions exploring how to balance effort accuracy and perceived autonomy the other grant is an assessment of machine learning algorithms in the wild this work led to the recently published pnas paper bayesian modeling of human ai complementarity as announced by uci the paper was co authored by steyvers and smyth along with heliodoro tejeda a graduate student in cognitive sciences and gavin kerrigan a ph d student in computer science funded by the hpi research center at uci the grants have led to other papers co authored by steyvers and smyth as well they worked with kerrigan on combining human predictions with model probabilities via confusion matrices and calibration a paper appearing in proceedings for the thirty fifth conference on neural information processing systems neurips 2021 and they worked with computer science ph d students disi ji and robby logan on active bayesian assessment of blackbox classifiers a paper appearing in proceedings for the thirty fifth aaai conference on artificial intelligence this line of work is part of a larger collaboration with about five or six ph d students says smyth markelle kelly one of those students is markelle kelly a computer science graduate student who last summer received a fellowship through uci s steckler center for responsible ethical and accessible technology create this year kelly was awarded a fellowship through the irvine initiative in ai law and society both the center and initiative are helping facilitate this interdisciplinary work the human machine collaboration between the cognitive sciences and computer science departments explores questions about how people and machines can work together as a team says kelly who is currently investigating how humans and ai can understand the strengths and weaknesses of each other to better delegate tasks by working alongside cognitive science researchers i can better understand theories about the human side of this problem and incorporate these ideas into potential solutions the resulting cross disciplinary experiments and findings are founded on a much more nuanced perspective than if only machine learning experts were involved smyth agrees computer science historically has been a little bit averse to getting humans in the loop but i think ai and machine learning researchers now realize that although our algorithms have been developed and tested in our labs for a decade or two without attracting much attention they are now being widely applied to address real problems involving real people he says as a consequence getting students early in their career involved in these kinds of interesting projects and in discussions related to how ai is being used will help ensure ai is used

why the healthcare industry is a field that can constantly evolve to support the ever changing needs of patients one of these technologies is data science which ty shao believes can spur beneficial discoveries and change in healthcare shao is a graduate student and program ambassador of uci s master of data science program and plans to utilize her data science education in healthcare because the medical field is really close to her heart my dad passed away from advanced kidney cancer when i was young when he initially started feeling discomfort doctors did not immediately suspect that it was cancer since he was a relatively healthy man so by the time he was officially diagnosed it was already too late as he had entered the later stages of cancer says shao this experience is what motivates shao to spend her time in the mds program and beyond participating in cancer research to impact and revolutionize the healthcare industry i intend to use the tools of data science to help expedite life saving diagnoses to cancer patients and improve overall patient care says shao i am interested in working on cancer research throughout my career as a data scientist so that i can help other families who are also afflicted by this disease her passion and interests in the medical field extend beyond her research and professional goals as well i also enjoy exercising and working out because i think it s incredibly important to be active and to maintain a healthy lifestyle the experiences i ve had throughout my life encouraged me to prioritize and value my physical health says shao before joining the mds program shao turned her love for math into an academic pursuit at the university of california riverside she majored in statistics because it s a discipline that has many real world applications and in her undergraduate studies shao learned about the field of data science shao knew uci would be the perfect school for furthering her interests in this industry being one of the few professional programs in the uc system that offered a graduate degree solely in the field of data science uci easily became my top choice for the school where i wanted to conduct my graduate studies shao says i always had an affinity toward the uc system having grown up in southern california since it is both close to home and offers a great educational experience shao enjoys her experience in the mds program she says the coursework taught by her professors is enriching and beneficial to her development as a data scientist she also loves learning alongside her peers i have also enjoyed meeting and bonding with the classmates in my cohort who also share my passion for data science she says from this program i am hoping to gain the necessary skills and connections that will be deeply integrated into my career in addition to achieving her professional goals in the mds program shao hopes to leverage her ambassadorship position to encourage women to pursue studies and careers in the data science field she says that in her experience as a woman studying statistics she is part of a minority group and her male classmates often overshadow her to shao it s important that more women enter data science and other stem fields and bring in unique perspectives that do not exist in male dominated spaces women have so much to offer to the industry and can provide additional perspectives and approaches to problems that are not considered by their male peers says shao as an ambassador for the mds program i am hoping to provide women with more exposure to the field of data science and to encourage them to also become involved in the development and advancement of this discipline with a number of ambitions and commitments life can be stressful so shao shared some activities she likes to do to de stress and have fun with her family and friends outside of school i enjoy cooking and baking as these are activities i find to be extremely therapeutic and rewarding says shao food is something that connects all types of people and brings different cultures together i love showing my appreciation towards my close friends and family members by making meals or baking delicious treats for them as the spring quarter begins that also means shao s first year in the mds program nears its end and her second year will begin soon shao wants to make the most of her education by gaining professional working experience and applying what she has learned to a practical real world setting from there i am hoping to acquire enough experience and knowledge so that i am eventually able to make significant contributions to cancer research she says i would like to establish my career as a data scientist in the healthcare field as it is one that i am immensely passionate about

county and other organizations develop grant proposals calculate sample sizes interpret data and design research databases in the deforest park neighborhood of north long beach however the wife and mother of two young children is better known as a community advocate she was recently recognized by assembly member mike gipson as the 2021 woman of the year and she has long helped local residents stay engaged and empowered over the years she has served on the north long beach neighborhood alliance uptown property and business improvement district pbid and citizens police complaint commission cpcc and she is currently chair of the long beach planning commission tackling complex issues such as affordable housing now as ricks oddie campaigns for long beach city council in district 9 her professional and personal lives are growing more intertwined her data driven approach paired with strong community engagement brings a unique skill set and perspective to a platform focused on homelessness economic development and small business recovery public health parks and open spaces diversity equity and inclusion and public safety assembly member mike gipson named dr joni ricks oddie shown here with her husband and two children 2021 woman of the year for california assembly district 64 professional and personal perspectivespublic health is one area in particular that spotlights the interconnected nature of ricks oddie s professional and personal experiences part of my campaign revolves around public health outreach to minority communities and marginalized communities says ricks oddie i want to lead conversations around health equity and funding of public health programs at the city level the pandemic has really highlighted the need for more structural funding for our health department and with my background in statistics and epidemiology i want to bring a more data driven lens to how we make decisions yet ricks oddie isn t only about the numbers as highlighted in a march 7 facebook post about the birth of her daughter chloe the issue of health equity is also personal for her in the post she recounts how she gave birth to her second child in a car outside the hospital after having been sent home two hours earlier a situation that likely led to life threatening medical complications that left ricks oddie in need of surgery a few weeks later as a black woman i m acutely aware that black babies face a higher than normal infant mortality rate and that black mothers face a higher than normal mortality rate after birth these differences are rooted in the burden that black mothers face due to systematic racial bias she posted as a researcher and academic i deal with data and statistics every day on that day my daughter could easily have become a statistic in the worst possible way in chloe s honor this women s history month i d like to bring greater awareness and respect to those mothers particularly black mothers who literally risk their lives to give birth wrote ricks oddie in a facebook post for her daughter s first birthday ricks oddie goes on to say that this experience was part of her motivation to run for city council one of the reasons i m running for city council is to bring my professional and personal perspective on women s health health equity public health and community health to my work on behalf of our city she is sharing her story to build awareness and to bring a name and a voice to some of the complex challenges facing the city and to encourage others to share their stories as well she credits the black infant health program in long beach with providing her a safe space to process her experience thinking about our healthcare system in totality insurance access care representation and the issues around implicit bias is difficult because these are all things you can t necessarily prove because there are so many dynamics was race a contributing factor these are hard conversations but they re conversations that need to happen data driven solutionsat the same time ricks oddie wants to ensure that any policy changes introduced are not only supported by the data but also tracked and evaluated to properly evaluate programs in the city we need to attach appropriate metrics to assess whether changes made are even working she says i want to advocate for the creation of an office of data and evaluation which would help city departments and staff figure out what data is out there to support a particular position or program change ricks oddie s unique skill set would allow her to help identify appropriate milestones and metrics for policies and then effectively package and visualize them for presentations to the city council and other strategic partners in the city and this approach could be applied to everything from healthcare to homelessness for example she knows from her work with various organizations that it takes an average of 17 touches to persuade someone who is homeless to agree to accept help a lot of community members get frustrated when nothing happens after they make just one call but people have rights you have to develop trust with people and that takes time and resources gathering and understanding the data helps quantify the time and resources needed while also providing important context for continued community engagement from a policy standpoint we really have to think about what resources we provide our health department our social services department and our police department she says because when people call about issues around loitering somebody camping on public property or issues around mental health all of that connects a lot of city departments she stresses the need to manage these different entities at a holistic level while also educating the public about the role they play in helping to address various issues ready to hit the ground runningof the nine neighborhood associations in district 9 ricks oddie has been endorsed by eight association presidents i ve worked with them for the last decade so they trust my opinion and know that i ll be somebody who will always have an open door policy with them and a listening ear she has also been endorsed by both the previous councilmember and by current councilmember rex richardson who is running for mayor they also know that i m somebody who will fiercely advocate for our community i already have a lot of relationships going in which will allow me to hit the ground running she says and while her professional background brings a high level of analytical skills and expertise to the table it s her ability to apply those skills in support policies that will actually improve people s daily lives that matters i tell people i m raising my family here and i want them to live in a community that they re proud of where it feels like their city and their city leaders care about their well being shani murray applications open for new uci summer biostatistics

will be offering a two week session titled data data analytics theory applications from july 25 to aug 5 high school students will be on campus monday through friday from 9 a m to 4 p m exploring the foundations of data science with real world hands on projects computer science is more than just programming the whole idea behind the summer academy is to offer a selection of courses to help high school students explore the various areas and topics that comprise the ever changing and growing field of computing explains computer science professor magda el zarki the director of the academy leading this effort we re starting off with this one course on data analytics it is a great way to launch the program given the tremendous interest that students have in data it s the big thing these days camp attendees will spend their days in the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci learning about data science methods and concepts through hands on projects using anonymized health data from actual patients the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci mornings will start with lessons from professor babak shahbaba of uci s department of statistics or from professor sam behseta of cal state fullerton s department of mathematics they will be teaching students how to collect process summarize and visualize data after a daily lunch break highly qualified and trained uci graduate and undergraduate students will lead small teams working on projects related to actual datasets often drawn for biological and medical sciences the teams will make predictions using statistical models test scientific hypotheses using statistical inference techniques and make decisions under uncertainty by applying statistical thinking for the students it will be exciting to work with actual datasets and see what it s like to make sense from databases comprising a jumble of numbers and more says el zarki students will learn how to manipulate the data make the models analyze their results and present it in a way that illustrates certain interesting conclusions it will be an eye opener for a lot of kids students will also get to tour the campus visit research labs in the school s departments of computer science informatics and statistics and explore career pathways in the many related fields of computing interested students must apply online by may 6 2022 the application is short but does require the name title and email address of a teacher principal or school administrator who when contacted can submit a letter of recommendation also by the may 6 deadline there is no application fee and the 2 500 program cost covers lunches snacks and all materials required ics will provide laptops with all the software needed for the course the first cohort will likely be around 30 students the plan is for the ics summer academy to grow in offerings and cohort size the goal for next year is to offer three or four courses eventually building up to around six to eight courses by 2025 serving up to 250 students each year i m very positive about this effort for the future because i think it s very different from anything else out there says el zarki we already have faculty really interested in covering other areas the focus of future sessions might include security game development the internet of things iot ai and machine learning quantum computing and more there might also be more advanced sessions on certain topics for those interested in learning more about a particular field the goal of the summer academy is to help students explore and get a better understanding of what it means to be a computer scientist and the exciting careers that one can pursue being one says el zarki we want to give them a good sense of the diversity and vastness of the field of computing all the areas of expertise and knowledge that it encompasses and that make it so exciting shani murray dr joni ricks oddie applies data driven lens

discussing everything from chocolate milk to dating apps and referencing shows like parks and recreation and rupaul s drag race an open access book co authored by mine dogucu removes barriers to learning bayesian statistics and finds new ways to engage readers i sincerely believe that a generation of students will cite this book as inspiration for their use of and love for bayesian statistics says duke university professor yue jiang in his review of bayes rules an introduction to applied bayesian modeling crc press 2022 this is perhaps the most engaging introductory statistics textbook i have ever read that was the goal when mine dogucu an assistant professor of teaching in uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics started collaborating with alicia a johnson and miles q ott on their bayes rules book which is freely available online or can be purchased from crc press as a hard copy paperback or e book a preprint by the authors outlines their commitment to accessibility and inclusivity while writing the book we wanted to make bayesian statistics more accessible for undergraduate students everywhere particularly novice learners says dogucu and for diverse groups of learners from different backgrounds to accomplish this they deliberately included a wide variety of entertaining examples and exercises as joseph k blitzstein of harvard university notes in his foreword you will encounter a vibrant sample of applications in this book ranging from weather prediction to lgbtq anti discrimination laws and from who calls soda pop or calls pop soda to how to classify penguin species most importantly careful study of this book will empower you to conduct thoughtful bayesian analyses for the data and applications you care about not surprisingly dogucu herself first became passionate about statistics after seeing its real world use in an application area she cared about what first sparked your interest in statistics i was a math major in a small liberal arts college statistics back then was not as popular especially for the small school and there was no statistics department per se it was within the math department i decided to take a statistics class and i remember very well the moment i decided i wanted to study more statistics we were working on a dataset about hurricane katrina about housing losses and damages and i was so impressed i thought wow we can actually use math to answer useful questions of course useful means something different for everyone but for me it means helping people so using statistics to understand problems impacting people was so fascinating to me and that s when i decided i needed to take more steps to study this why is there now a need for books on bayesian statistics targeted at the undergraduate level bayesian statistics itself is not new but traditionally it has not been taught widely there are many reasons for this one reason is that it is computationally challenging second in the past there were more criticisms surrounding the subjectivity of bayesian methods it s becoming more popular because we now have greater computing power and the scientific community or part of the community has reevaluated subjectivity more schools are offering a bayesian course now another reason is that there are two big paradigms in statistics one is frequentist and the other is bayesian so if we don t teach bayesian we are not really giving our students the full picture of different approaches to statistical analysis also there s this key value that is almost always reported in scientific studies the benchmark p less than 0 05 the p value is overused and often misused in studies experts argue that when writing a whole scientific study it shouldn t all come down to just the p value and one of the suggestions in the field of statistics is to make more room for bayesian methods the american statistical association put out a statement on p values and it starts with a quote about why colleges teach p 0 05 we teach it because it s what we do we do it because it s what we teach so if we actually teach bayesian methods that s one way to help break that cycle it brings an additional perspective to statistical analyses beyond the p value we have to prepare our students for that how is uci s department of statistics preparing students i recently co authored a preprint on the current state of undergraduate bayesian education and we were looking at courses across the nation in the highest ranked 100 universities and 50 liberal arts colleges we found 46 institutions that offer a bayesian course but most of these were elective courses only four institutions required bayesian statistics and uci is very special because we were one of them we offer an undergraduate course every winter stats 115 introduction to bayesian data analysis and it s a required course for our data science program so it s not surprising that this course is accessible at the undergraduate level at uci we have many famous bayesians in our department including hal stern wes johnson michele guindani veronica berrocal and babak shahbaba so ics is just a good bayesian place and we re also collaborating with other schools for example as part of a recent nsf grant cal state fullerton will start offering a new course like ours you wanted readers to find people like themselves in the book how did you achieve that goal so we assume that our readers will have diverse backgrounds because we started with our own students and our own students have diverse backgrounds but at the same time we aimed for this book to be accessible to everyone you don t necessarily have to be an undergraduate student we wanted it to be relevant to different cultures for instance there s an example taken from u s elections with presidential candidates going through primaries although other political systems might have primaries it s not universal so to use that example we had to give the context so we tried really hard to read the book from different perspectives to make it as accessible as possible to a diverse group of learners from different backgrounds what is one of your favorite examples from the book one part of the book that i really like is the statistical model evaluation and the reason for that is because at least in the books i used to read as a student myself model evaluation mostly focused on statistical numbers for example some model evaluation criteria that we would calculate but in our book in addition to that we also focus on ethical aspects of statistical models like is the model biased how were the data collected how could the model impact individuals or society at large i really like that this is included in the book how do you think the field of statistics might change based on greater diversity and inclusion this book is not the only thing that s going to make our field more diverse i think it might create small changes like a reader might see one example in the book that they connect to or an instructor might be inspired to make their materials more accessible but these are all small water drops in the bucket of course our aspiration is to have a bigger impact on the field but that usually comes from institutional changes like providing access to more opportunities for students in addition to affordability you also made the content accessible for people with visual disabilities yes we made sure to use color blind friendly color palettes in addition the online version of the book supports alternate text that is image descriptions read by screen readers alternate text not only makes images accessible to the blind and visually impaired but also to everyone because for instance they show up in internet searches to the best of my knowledge bayes rules is the first statistics e textbook that supports alternate text and you were deliberate in whom you cited in the book and how you cited them why unfortunately the way citations work is that usually we cite people who are already cited a lot we don t go out of our way at least i didn t before writing this book to pay attention to why i was citing someone so in preparation of the book we tried to read more authors from diverse groups to make sure we were including different points of view and that s not just for the book but to benefit us as educators by reading more then we wanted to make sure the book captured all those different scholars we also paid close attention to citing trans authors correctly actually my first quarter here at uci i cited an article on transgender scholars in my blog on inclusivity before even realizing tess informatics professor theresa tanenbaum was here in my school but basically we tried really hard to check their websites so we didn t just rely on how other people cited them finally what informed your decision to make the book open access this was of course a mutual decision with my co authors and their reasons might be similar or different but from my perspective textbooks are unaffordable as a student i was on a textbook scholarship from my school so i could buy books through that luckily here at uci we even have students who have food insecurity i wouldn t want to say to them don t buy food buy my own book especially considering that students actually contributed to the book maybe not by writing it but i ve been basically using some drafts of it for three years my students found typos and helped me see what examples were most effective and i learned from their responses to the material so they were actually part of the writing process which makes it unreasonable to ask them to pay for it i don t know the exact numbers but hundreds of people are accessing the online book on a daily basis from many different countries so it s been a great decision if students cannot access the book they cannot learn from it so accessibility was our number one goal i don t think a print book would have reached as many readers shani

california r users group socal rug a local forum of people who use the statistical programming language r bella feng sep dadsetan and john preach were the featured panelists along with ryan benz the three of them shared their experiences working in the data science industry focusing on their career development over the years career growth bella feng the first question of the night was how one can stand out at work and form positive relationships with their colleagues bella feng head of statistical programming and clinical trial data science at biotechnology company eqrx started the discussion by encouraging everyone to be engaged and open minded feng mentioned that she got her first job because of a presentation she did at a statistical analysis system sas conference to feng it s important to build strong relationships with those around you because they can pay off in the long run in your career sep dadsetan sep dadsetan who is the executive director of real world evidence analytics at healthcare and artificial intelligence company concertai agreed with feng and emphasized the significance of knowing the structure of your company and how you interact with your colleagues to understand the impact of your role it s really important to send an email introduce yourself and try to connect with others and see what they re working on dadsetan said i think through that you ll see where you can contribute and how the company is organized john peach in addition to networking john peach principal data scientist at cloud technology company oracle and member of socal rug says using data to inform decisions and be customer focused while keeping the company vision in mind can improve your work performance and relationships with your clients for data scientists one of the big parts of the job is to be a trusted adviser your job is to help the people that make decisions make the decision that s based around what the data is telling them as opposed to what their gut says peach said make sure that what you re going to do has some real impact along the way and you should be able to identify everything that you re doing and what the impact is going to be like for the customer biotechnology company seer s director of data science and socal rug member ryan benz led the latter half of the panel s discussion on career growth with a lighting round to discuss career growth and pitfalls ryan benz benz and the panelists noted that being curious dependable and a problem solver and having people skills are signs that an employee may be ready to be promoted when asked to share some examples of what might set back professionally they said being indecisive and having a limited or negative mindset may hurt you to avoid stumbling in your career peach re emphasized looking at the bigger picture and advised performing at the level you want to be promoted to and taking ownership of your work management vs individual contributor career tracksthe panel discussion shifted to focus on two career tracks being a manager versus being an individual contributor peach described one of the differences between being a manager and an individual contributor being the scope and type of their responsibilities while individual contributors manage themselves and are responsible for their projects a manager s role entails managing people such as overseeing personnel and creating teams in that sense being a manager is almost like being a parent according to feng dadseten added that good managers understand the scope of their own knowledge and skills and will help you find the support you need if they cannot personally provide certain resources the panelists then discussed how one knows if being a manager or an individual contributor is the right role for them understanding how you want to manage your impact at work is one thing to consider to give an example peach noted that being a technical leader allows you to have an impact throughout your organization but your impact is still focused on your area of expertise on the other hand a manager will have a broader impact on both projects and the people they re guiding as you re going up the ic individual contributor track ask yourself if you are enjoying the project management aspects more than you re enjoying the technical hands on work peach said that s a good indication that maybe taking on some management role would be interesting to you being a manager also gives you more influence in the workplace which is one of the things feng enjoys i really like the influence part said feng adding that she championed the use of r in a previous role but was unsuccessful because she was not a decision maker so once there was a reorganization my initiative was killed because everything was outsourced but right now i m not an individual contributor and more like the decision maker so i can decide dadsetan said that as you progress in your career it s good to take note of what you like and dislike and what you re good at and not good at because these are all factors that come into play when deciding what role you find best fits you i think it s important to realize that it s not a decision you have to make now and can never go back to ever dadsetan said there s relatively fluidity balancing personal professional lifecareer advancement inevitably comes with more expectations and responsibilities that can even interfere with your personal life benz said that managing stress and experiencing burnout are not talked about enough even in school so the panel discussion ended with everyone sharing how they handle the demands of their careers dadsetan acknowledged that you might hit the ground running straight out of college but it s imperative you don t overwork yourself and start drawing lines as needed as an individual you have to balance being fresh out of school wanting to make a good impression wanting to do your best so that might require you to work overtime dadsetan said but it s also really important to be listening to your body and know what it is that you want to prioritize in your life and take stock of what matters to you setting boundaries at work is also a way that feng maintains a healthy work life balance in the past she juggled a number of roles and responsibilities all at once at work causing her to burn out feng said attending a weeklong retreat and connecting with herself without electronics helped her recover and be more in tune with her body another way to prevent burnout is by learning to separate your personal and professional life it s a job it s not my identity peach said for a very long time my self identity was tied to what i was doing making that separation has helped a lot it can also help to find purpose in your career so that you are moving up learning new things and specializing rather than being stuck doing the same tasks or trying to do everything at once i personally am much better if i know that i m having personal growth i m learning a lot peach said focus on where your talents are as you go up in your career you re going to be more and more specialized in what you re known for so focus on doing that as opposed to doing everything karen phan don t think you can learn bayesian statistics think again with bayes rules qu elected international statistical institute member quick links news archive

expo held in the new state of the art interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb the event was a culmination of months of hard work offering the students the opportunity to present projects completed for undergraduate capstone courses in informatics computer science and data science as well as for the butterworth product development competition project sponsors and students alike look forward to this annual opportunity to highlight projects they ve labored over throughout the year students presenting their work in the iseb lobby at the ics project expo partnering with industry the expo really ties together the four foundational elements of engagement that our programs offer project experience entrepreneurship mentorship and opportunities for internship says jason king senior associate director of corporate relations in ics the expo benefits project sponsors looking to recruit and showcases all the great work of our students these ics undergraduates spent anywhere from 10 to 20 weeks experiencing hands on learning working on real world projects collaborating with industry partners peter colligan a senior technology executive for the sap s 4hana industry cloud was one of 40 industry professionals in attendance at the expo speaking of sap s goal of helping to accelerate collaboration between academia startups and industry colligan stresses the importance of these types of events i get a chance to directly and informally interact with student teams and talk about the engineering skills and projects they care about those discussions can sometimes go deeper where professors themselves step in and get a chance to highlight and validate ideas and common challenges with industry practitioners he continues very realistic and concrete outcomes have come out of this such as ideas for future capstone projects full time employment work or joint industry research initiatives jason king thanks the corporate partners gaining real world experiencerecognizing the tremendous benefits of providing opportunities for practical application and industry engagement the department of informatics has been offering a capstone course for more than a dozen years it is now a graduation requirement for informatics and ics has also added elective undergraduate capstone courses for computer science and data science majors presenting your work professionally in a conference like event is a very valuable experience for our undergraduate students says computer science professor sergio gago masague who launched the computer science capstone course in 2020 i personally enjoyed watching students and sponsors engaging in very interesting discussions about projects and ideas for future work one of the top computer science capstone projects leveraged artificial intelligence to create a personalized recommendation system for quick service restaurants qsrs for the ai driven personalized menu content for the qsr drive thu project students ezra hammond rieko konishi arian namavar and ryan sakuma partnered with delphi display systems they developed a machine learning system that presents relevant items to users based on their preferences and dietary restrictions to improve the drive thru experience they also presented their project and competed at the national capstone design conference in dallas texas on june 6 2022 the capstone project gave me the confidence that after my four years of education under the school of ics i am ready to tackle new and unfamiliar projects successfully and implement what i ve learned says namavar who graduated in june during the interviews i had with various companies i would always answer their questions with my experience with our ics capstone sponsor and project in mind which i think helped me secure an offer namavar will be working as a software developer at nisum the ics expo was also a great opportunity to present our project and take ownership of our result seeing the progress other students made was another aspect that made me proud of ics informatics lecturer darren denenberg was similarly impressed by the students progress noting that everyone was able to achieve something

it was a project i thought no one would be interested in and it ended up being one of the best groups best projects and they also went to dallas to compete in the national capstone conference professor denenberg left and ics dean marios right listen to students pitch their products informatics professor hadar ziv attended the conference with the audioscribe team and says they represented themselves and the school of ics very well they really held their own conducting multiple high quality presentations and enjoying their interactions with their peers and with capstone instructors from around the country however even students who don t have space in their schedule for a capstone course or conference or who aren t upperclassmen have opportunities for entrepreneurship thanks to the butterworth competition this product development competition is designed to encourage the creation of new technologies with the potential for commercialization this year s winning project leprendo was on display at the ics project expo letting participants view the online farmer s marketplace created by computer science major dylan riffle computer science and engineering major kanu chandra business administration major dan ta and psychological sciences major nina nguyen by developing our pitch deck and going through the competition we learned the importance of being able to combine the technical development of a product with business development and communicate this effectively says riffle the team will continue to develop leprendo over the summer we re firing on all cylinders and increasingly promoting the value of capstone projects showing why regional and national companies should be involved with these programs and the talent pipelines they offer says king our programs are

minor in statistics current course listings news seminars news seminar center for statistical consulting conference experience confirms competitive edge of ics capstone program july 25 2022 what are some of the benefits of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics aside from the fact that it s the only computing focused school in the uc system and happens to sit in the middle of silicon beach it also offers capstone courses that provide hands on experience in a practical real world environment the strength and importance of such programs was reiterated june 6 8 2022 when ics faculty students and staff attended the national capstone design conference in dallas texas i came away from the capstone design conference even more convinced that providing hands on practical experience is essential to prepare our students for life after college says informatics lecturer matthew bietz during his projects in human computer interaction capstone course students take all of the skills they have learned in ics classrooms and put them together in the context of a software development project these projects require students to balance real world priorities deadlines and resource constraints they have to understand client needs and figure out how to best meet them given their team s strengths and weaknesses he explains our capstone program gives our students a real competitive edge in the job market this year some of the top students from the ics undergraduate capstone program with course offerings for informatics computer science and data science majors traveled to dallas to present their projects at the same time ics faculty and staff learned about and shared best practices uci students taking a break from the conference to explore plano texas sharing best practicesone goal of the biennial capstone design conference is to provide a forum for sharing ideas it features sessions focused on how to engage industry partners bring in dollars for philanthropic support manage courses and so on the conference gave us the chance to find out what is working and not working at other schools learn about tools and techniques for organizing and teaching capstone courses and network with colleagues says bietz it also gave him the opportunity to share some best practices from ics collaborating with informatics professor hadar ziv who has been leading capstone courses in ics since 2009 bietz co authored a paper for the conference on empowering capstone students in client interactions they point out in the paper that most student training has been in classroom settings where the structure of tasks is well defined the expectations are clear and the instructor is an absolute authority they argue that a critical lesson gained from the capstone experience is learning how to have a productive disagreement with a client ziv also co authored a paper with colleagues from texas a m and from brazil on adapting scrum ceremonies in undergraduate capstone projects the paper talks about getting student teams to follow agile values and principles and scrum activities and best practices while acknowledging important differences between a scrum team in the real world and undergraduate students in a capstone course these were just two of the more than 30 papers and posters presented at the conference ziv also presented two workshop sessions in collaboration with uci alumnus david ochi director of the beall student design and butterworth product development competitions the workshops covered how to generate ideas and how to translate projects into startups ics had a strong showing at the conference not just by the number of papers posters workshops and other activities but also by a strong attendance and active engagement with all other attendees says ziv our presence was well noticed and well received jason king senior associate director of corporate relations in ics agreed noting that it was a win win situation we attended this conference hoping to take away some golden nuggets or gems learning from other institutions he compared it to being an athlete seeking out better competition during training if you truly want to grow and be the best soccer player you need to get outside of your region to compete against other players to raise that bar and this is a perfect example of that he explains this is the first time we ve gone outside of our region and it s only helping us grow now we re opening up those communication channels and people respect our feedback and vice versa presenting projects and networkingwhile half of the conference focused on best practices the other half focused on student engagement with students competing presenting and networking with their peers and also meeting with high school students interested in computer science and engineering our students who attended the conference were amazing says bietz presenting their projects in a competitive poster session was a great learning experience and they got great feedback from the judges and other attendees the conference also provided an opportunity for them to network with students from other schools meet representatives of tech companies and strengthen their bond with each other connecting with other students was a highlight for jessie chang a business information management major who presented her team s project canvas tools for teachers the tools she helped design aim to alleviate common challenges in the existing education model i enjoyed meeting new people the most there were so many different teams from different parts of the countries she says it was just really cool meeting them and learning about their projects she added that she learned a lot about engineering the conference seems more geared toward engineering students so it was a surprise to all of us that our projects were even accepted as it was all software king noted that the conference is making an effort to incorporate more computer science students and projects into its biennial event the capstone conference in dallas was a fantastic opportunity to showcase two quarters of hard work as well as engage with students and professors from all over the united states says software engineering major ellen kulla who presented the audioscribe cough diarization project with teammates alexis diaz jinli duan qiantai duan and yuan wang audioscribe developed in a capstone course taught by informatics lecturer darren denenberg analyzes different sounds for use in clinical research and healthcare settings the conference adds kulla really showed us how much students are able to accomplish as a group in a short period of time jason king front right with audioscribe team members another ics project presented was developed by computer science students ezra hammond rieko konishi arian namavar and ryan sakuma the students collaborated with delphi display systems in a capstone course taught by computer science professor sergio gago masague to develop a recommendation system for quick service restaurants qsrs my team had the opportunity to attend the conference and it was an amazing experience getting to represent the school of ics and interact with sponsors companies colleges and universities from all over the u s and canada says namavar their project ai driven personalized menu content for the qsr drive thru uses a machine learning system to present relevant items to users based on their preferences and dietary restrictions cultivating that competitive edge the capstone program is the one of the best things about ics showcasing the great work that s going on within the school from undergraduate students says king the program provides opportunities for internships and professional development helps students learn how to apply technical skills and use various project management and communication tools and lets them practice soft skills and networking in a real world environment we want to make sure we re using best practices when it comes to these offerings and that our program is on par if not better than other standout schools across the nation says king this

from july 11 through august 19 2022 twenty three students from around the u s came to uci for the newly launched irvine summer institute in biostatistics and undergraduate data science isi buds the institute is part of the summer institute in biostatistics program offered through the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid this year uci became only the 10th university in the nation to host this free six week summer training course aimed at addressing the growing need for biostatisticians and data scientists offered through the department of statistics in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics the isi buds program provides not only training in the fundamentals of biostatistics data science and computing but also experience in conducting cutting edge biomedical research the main goal is to excite students about careers and graduate school in biostatistics says statistics professor vladimir minin who co directs the program with ics colleagues dan gillen babak shahbaba and mine dogucu careers in biostatistics are peculiar in the sense that a lot of them require a graduate degree so there s a need for more training in this area explains minin however biostatistics is rarely taught at the undergraduate level so many undergraduate students do not know about career opportunities in this area sarah schlund a senior at uc santa barbara double majoring in statistics and data science and in geography agrees i had been searching for an opportunity to gain experience in biostatistics prior to committing to a five year doctorate program in the field however such opportunities are few and far between she says isi buds offers the rare opportunity to gain biostatistics experience as an undergraduate and learn from the very impressive faculty at uci who have immense biostatistics knowledge and experience both in industry and academic research ics faculty members and the inaugural cohort of students for the irvine summer institute in biostatistics and undergraduate data science an impressive inaugural cohortthe inaugural cohort of students selected from more than 150 applications came from a wide variety of schools including the university of connecticut emory university montana state university the university of arizona university of michigan university of vermont and university of washington there was also a regional presence with students from uci uc riverside uc santa barbara and ucla the highly competitive program includes up to 500 in travel expenses free housing and a meal plan or a 2 500 stipend as well as 600 for incidental expenses the cohort was also a diverse group of students with almost 40 coming from groups that are underrepresented in the quantitative sciences we were able to recruit a significant number of students from historically excluded backgrounds with the hope of increasing diversity in the field of biostatistics says minin that was a very important goal because many are first generation college students who typically lack information about graduate school and about the many career options open to them the program included career preparedness activities including a workshop on the grad school application process and a q a with ph d students and outlined classes that students should take to have a more competitive application making this information available to everyone levels the playing field a little bit explains minin people from pharmaceutical and biotech companies including uci data science graduate jessica george came to talk with students about careers in the biotech industry in addition communications coach bri mcwhorter gave a two hour workshop on how to present scientific information helping prepare students for their research presentations on the final day of the program karren messer who is a professor and chief of the division of biostatistics at the herbert wertheim school of public health at uc san diego gave a talk and offered students valuable feedback on their presentations it was a very impressive group of students says gillen chair of the uci department of statistics they came in and within six weeks they did three weeks of courses both on technical and soft skills and then they jumped right into three weeks of real research pounding out an amazing amount of work and giving wonderful presentations at the end of it real world research a smashing successstudents attending the program started with lectures and labs conducted by six different instructors and a statistics ph d student teaching assistant learning how to design and analyze clinical trials model infectious disease dynamics and analyze big data in genomics transcriptomics and imaging the students came from various backgrounds so we spent the first three weeks making sure they were all on the same page in terms of their technical knowledge says minin we devoted this time to checking off all the boxes of what they needed to know for their research projects students then worked under the supervision of research mentors in addition to statistics professors gillen minin and shahbaba the following also served as mentors louis ehwerhemuepha manager of computational research choc research institute lauren gyllenhammer assistant professor of pediatrics uci daniel parker assistant professor of population health and disease prevention uci elizabeth read assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering uci and pathik wadhwa professor of psychiatry human behavior uci the real heart of the program was the research projects and that was only possible because of the dedication of the biomedical scientists whom we asked to participate says minin it was a smashing success because of their engagement with the students in addition four statistics ph d students provided invaluable support to the teams during the project phase of the institute the research covered the following topics analyzing the impact of maternal stress volatility during pregnancy on child health outcomes predicting maternal stress during pregnancy understanding movement patterns of farmers and forest workers from the thailand myanmar border conducting a spatio temporal analysis of melioidosis cases in lao people s democratic republic uncovering gene gene interaction motifs from single cell transcriptomic data and assessing associations between congenital conditions and covid 19 severity in children i was motivated to apply to this program because i was thrilled to get my hands on some real world biomedical data do collaborative research and learn from world class experts in statistics by means of the uci department of statistics faculty says dante ramirez an undergraduate majoring in statistics and minoring in bioethics at the university of washington what i liked best about the program was the opportunity to collaborate with like minded statisticians in a clinical research setting working with a cohort of statisticians and data scientists with relatively homogeneous skills in this setting and being guided by statistical mentors is such a special opportunity in learning my own strengths and weaknesses how to effectively communicate and work with others and how to do contemporary clinical and quantitative research although ramirez had originally intended to go straight into industry after graduating he has since changed his plans the isi buds program convinced me to apply to a biostatistics or public health graduate school program as this would make my goal of transitioning into a public health regulatory position much more attainable the research groups have some fun after giving their presentations left vladimir minin pink shirt and right dan gillen blue shirt with their student groups exploring so calboth ramirez and schlund were impressed by the research experience gained as well as by the ability to enjoy some downtime and explore southern california i was pleasantly surprised with the culture of the department and how plentiful the weekend activities were says ramirez as they were very conducive of bonding between my cohort and meeting various graduate students schlund agreed the professors also made large efforts to get to know us personally outside of dedicated lecture and research time they planned and attended weekend events that included kayaking whale watching hiking etc she says every professor in the program has been exceptionally personable kind and genuine to every student in the program summer 2023isi buds has secured funding for a minimum of five years so planning for summer 2023 is already underway registration will open in march 2023 and you can visit the application page for more information we want to make sure that we re feeding a diverse pipeline for the stem fields in general but also for biostatistics and statistics says gillen so we re going to continue to grow the program we hope that it becomes a hallmark of the department to be able to attract bright students into the graduate programs not just at uci but for

top 10 jobs in 2022 according to u s news world report the growing popularity of data focused careers has created a demand for students who understand the immense challenges and real world impact of complex data analysis this demand is the backdrop for the socal data science program a collaborative effort between faculty from uci california state university fullerton csuf and cypress college aimed at recruiting training and dispatching a diverse workforce of stem and data science majors led by statistics professors babak shahbaba and mine dogucu of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics and mathematics professor roberto pelayo the program is funded through a national science foundation grant preparing a diverse workforce via academic and industrial partnership with 1 5 million in funding across the three institutes and over the next three years the goal is to recruit 120 fellows from the three campuses offering targeted coursework and hands on training research opportunities and career development workshops the program is off to a strong start with 32 fellows selected from a pool of more than 200 applicants this diverse cohort is 87 women and students from other historically underrepresented backgrounds having such a diverse and strong group of students is amazing says shahbaba that was one of the goals of the program students and faculty of the socal data science program during the winter and spring this first cohort of students took data science courses developed through the socal data science program and offered at uci csuf or cypress college then the students put their new skills to the test with a summer research project rigorous training at summer bootcampprior to starting the six week research project students attended a one week bootcamp at uci the topics covered included exploratory data analysis advanced r programing and generalized linear models we had students coming from different backgrounds and fields computer science statistics biological sciences and we wanted to make sure that before they started doing research they had the required skills says shahbaba the bootcamp brought everyone together in terms of research preparedness the students really helped each other and worked well together the bootcamp also included a session on ethics in data science as well as training in professional and academic development we focused on more than just data science covering resume writing and interview skills says shahbaba and we invited graduate students to talk about their experiences in grad school real world research experienceonce the bootcamp ended students broke into several groups with each group diving into a real world data analysis project it was six weeks of intense research says shahbaba they were on campus at least three days a week from 10 a m to 4 p m working in the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci designed for collaborative research it s such a well designed space for these kind of projects it made our collaboration with the industrial and academic partners very smooth and productive students collaborating in an iseb classroom shahbaba lined up a variety of academic and non academic partners for the summer projects children s hospital of orange county choc the center of hydro meteorology and remote sensing chrs the fleischman lab the fortin lab and the reich lab the program was an amazing experience for me because it really gave me a chance to apply skills i learned from my courses to real world problems says program fellow giles pierre carlos a data science major at uci i was able to apply the techniques i ve learned and build significant models for an extremely interesting area of neuroscience research at the undergraduate research symposium on aug 4 2022 the last day of the summer program carlos and his teammates presented their work on understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of memory their project modeling nonspatial sequence memory task using neural decoding leveraged data provided by dr norbert fortin and the fortin lab at uci the program was collaborative in nature and because of that i learned how to solve statistical problems in a team setting says carlos on top of that the program solidified my interest in obtaining a master s in statistics and even made me open to going for a ph d in the future overall the program made a huge impact on where i want to take my career alyssandrei parinas who is studying computer science at cypress college and worked with carlos on the neuroscience project agreed the entire experience was challenging yet very rewarding she says the program taught me a lot of things and allowed me to better understand what data science is ayah halabi a mathematics major at csuf conducted research on how diet can affect symptoms related to myeloproliferative neoplasms mpn a cancer located within the blood and bone marrow her team s project impact of mediterranean and dash diets on mpn symptoms leveraged data from dr angela fleischman of uci s school of medicine and the fleischman lab this program has taught me so much about the data science world and how important it is to make our lives better wrote halabi in a linkedin post i fell in love with the field and with all the challenges and complexities it holds i m so grateful to have learned such important skills and worked with amazing faculty there were also projects related to covid 19 and pediatric cystic fibrosis that leveraged data from choc and a project on smartphones and infant language development used data from stephanie reich of uci s school of education the final team analyzed rainfall over time using data provided by phu nguyen and chrs students

september 22 2022 in july 2022 the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics welcomed hengrui cai as an assistant professor of statistics can you tell us a bit about your background and how you decided on statistics i m originally from southeastern china and i m the only child in my family growing up my mom and my grandma encouraged me to be independent and to seek a career i would enjoy and fight for my entire life when i took the exam to go to college i got full marks in mathematics this gave me the confidence to choose a mathematics related major as an undergraduate student at zhejiang university what inspired me to do a deep dive into the statistics major was the fourth industrial revolution happening during that time related to the realization of society version 5 0 we re in the process of imagining some new society where we will heavily rely on big data to solve challenges and to figure out how people can use artificial intelligence to live better therefore i decided to get a minor in the advanced honor class of engineering education at chu kochen honors college which granted me great opportunities to work with outstanding peers across the university and learn cutting edge technologies to integrate statistics and machine learning elegantly what motivated you to then earn your ph d during my undergraduate i attended several mathematical and machine learning competitions and won the meritorious winner in american mathematical contest yet i could still see my limitations in knowledge which motivated me to reach for the highest standard and become an expert in statistics and machine learning after a summer research internship at the university of alberta in canada i decided to go abroad for higher education and came to the united states after earning my bachelor s degree i spent five years at north carolina state university and got my ph d in statistics under the co supervision of dr wenbin lu and dr rui song my dissertation was on optimal decision making and policy evaluation with complex data which leverage causal inference and reinforcement learning to help us make the right decisions for the right people at the right time during that time i also spent three years interning at amazon that was another excellent opportunity for me to see the real world impact of computer science and statistics and how our research contributes to industry and society can you talk about your research focus i have broad research interests in methodology and theory in causal inference reinforcement learning and graphical modeling and in how they interact to establish reliable powerful and interpretable solutions to a variety of real world problems currently i m working in two main directions one is personalized decision making and policy evaluation for complex data this area integrates the techniques of causal inference and reinforcement learning which enables us to answer counterfactual questions so we can make better decisions in an interactive environment some use cases include precision medicine and personalized recommendations in e commerce i m also very interested in causal discovery with emerging challenges in big data this area leverages causal inference and graphical models to disentangle the complex relationship among variables and deliver the results in an explainable way my long term research goal is to teach a machine to learn the logic from the facts so what brought you to uci first of all i love irvine this city is vivid elegant and multicultural with a lot of young tech companies presenting appealing opportunities for collaboration the second reason is owing to the great research communities inside uci and around the uc system there are so many outstanding faculty members here i would like to work with in my department in the school of ics and across the university also where else can we find the departments of statistics computer science and informatics all in the same school it s a very unique place what courses will you be teaching i will be teaching a course in spring 2023 for undergraduates called introduction to probability and statistics in the future i would like to design some new courses on reinforcement machine learning and on causal discovery is there a book you d like to recommend to students the book of why by judea pearl and dana mackenzie this book is for non technical people who are interested in causal discovery explaining how we understand or formulate causality in real problems and highlighting the difference between correlation and causation it helps us understand the logic of things happening dive into the essence of human thought and use the causal principle as the key to applying artificial intelligence to solve real problems in meaningful ways what do you do in your spare time i like hiking going to the beach and being out in the sunshine i also like to go kayaking and standup paddle boarding if i have a bit more time i like to travel to new places i ve only been in irvine for a few months and i ve already been to las vegas death valley antelope valley and san francisco then from san francisco i drove down the coast to los angeles next i plan to visit san diego and yosemite work hard play hard i enjoy different views which open my eyes and my mind i also like to watch movies to experience different lives one of my favorites is forrest gump hengrui cai at death valley left and along california state route 1 right finally what do you like best so far about uci the people here are so nice i have received a lot of support from my department chair faculty members and department staff during my relocation and onboarding which is extremely helpful for the early stage of my career there are also plenty of opportunities for collaborating and i have been invited to give some talks for example i gave a talk in early september on optimal subgroup identification via constrained policy tree search for choc research i will continue to explore the fantastic research community at and around uci as i study how statistics and machine learning can uniquely contribute to interdisciplinary solutions and i will

third year he transitioned to computer science graduating with a b s in that discipline in 1974 in the mid 1970s uci established a master s degree program in computer science and butterworth was one of its early graduates uci is where i began my career as a computer scientist and software engineer he said while at uci i met another person who was a graduate student at the time and we ended up working together well into the 1980s you could say uci is where all of my success really started butterworth said he would not have been able to complete his college education without the monetary support he received as a student i was considering not going to the university unless i received financial aid because i didn t have any money but when uci came through with a package to help out that

long beach city council member watch her inauguration online starting at minute 58 30 as a child joni ricks oddie would often join her grandfather at county commissioner meetings in chicago so it s no surprise that when ricks oddie was sworn in for her new seat on the long beach city council on dec 22 2022 she had her family in tow she took her oath of office with her right arm raised and her left arm holding her young daughter as a wife and mother of two small children it is of utmost importance to me that we make our civic spaces open welcoming and inclusive teaching the next generation the necessity of civic engagement she said during her inauguration speech that lesson starts with them seeing their parents have the ability to be full members and make their voices heard i want to lead by example and let people know families are always welcome in addition to exemplifying her life as a mom in support of family friendly civic spaces ricks oddie also spotlighted her work in epidemiology and statistics in support of more impactful leadership as someone with a science and research background i want to bring data and metrics to the way we make decisions in the city she noted to ensure we are making the most well informed decisions on the ways we invest in our city particularly our most vulnerable communities ricks oddie earned her ph d in epidemiology from ucla and now serves as director of the center for statistical consulting housed in uc irvine s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics she is also director of the biostatistics epidemiology and research design berd unit within uci s institute for clinical and translational sciences icts this professional backdrop gives her a unique understanding of the power of data and as she takes on her new role as council member for the city of long beach representing district 9 she plans to leverage that knowledge to positively impact her community what was the most memorable part of your inauguration the official swearing is at the city clerk s office but the public inauguration ceremony was a ton of fun i had my friend and mentor yvonne wheeler who is president of the l a county federation of labor swear me in and my husband and two kids were supposed to be on stage with me but my son had to go to the bathroom he said he couldn t hold it so my father in law took him as i was giving my speech but it worked out perfectly because my speech talked about the importance of family and children and civic engagement the reason i bring my kids to everything is to make it an inclusive space for families i live in a community of young people of color so we have a lot of families moving in how are we going to grow the next generation of civic leaders if people aren t comfortable bringing their kids so it starts with us as leaders demonstrating that it s okay so just as i finish talking about this and i m shaking hands with some of the other city council members my father in law returns with my son i pick him up and give him a hug and then he says i wanna say something and he grabs the microphone and says hi i m cohen many people thought that was the highlight of the event it was a perfect example of the importance of family and just being a mom in the middle of all that so that was my favorite moment joni ricks oddie holding her son at the inauguration ceremony for the long beach city council how does your position as director of the center for statistical consulting help you in this role at my second city council meeting we announced an emergency declaration on homelessness we have an emergency operation center called the elc and we have around a 100 staff members in long beach dedicated to spending the next 100 days focusing completely on homelessness and sending us reports so the friday before our second meeting is when we got our homelessness report and it was 100 pages i had to read and analyze the report before our tuesday meeting this is the benefit of having somebody with a ph d who is used to looking at data and quickly determining what s happening joni ricks oddie at a city council meeting i ll give you another example there was a slide talking about race and ethnicity related to homelessness because we re trying to approach the problem with an equity lens to identify which racial groups are most heavily impacted in long beach it s african americans so on this one slide there were two data points that just seemed contradictory to each other one was saying that black people tend to spend the fewest days unhoused but they were also vastly more likely to be back on the street 12 months after being housed like 62 compared to the 20 for the next highest group which were white people so what the heck is happening that we get black people off the street quickly but within a year we are back where we started in the meeting i pointed out that this cycle is alarming i then had residents and advocates thanking me for the depth of my questions because i m not sure others had enough time to review the data to make that connection how do your efforts to address the needs of your community give you a different lens for viewing your work in academia it s the importance of implementation we do all this research but we often don t get to see the final dissemination and implementation how do we take what we do and literally translate it into something that impacts people that s exactly what i get the opportunity to do now which is why the work is so important it s basically asking how do you take best practices which is what we re supposed to be doing here as researchers and implement that but then the counterpoint is if we re trying to implement these policies what s the feedback loop to research that s what s missing which is why i think somebody with my background is important to have in a position like this we don t have the feedback loop to know which programs and policies didn t work out the way we thought they would when scaled for a larger audience but having that knowledge can inform how we do our research and create useful interventions you ve said that you want to advocate for an office of data and evaluation why is that important data is great and information is great but what are you going to do with it how can it influence policy and help you apply for grants that can lead to interventions i m hoping to demonstrate to my council colleagues over time that data tells you a story and then based on that story you can present a series of policies to address inequities the level of challenges that we re dealing with right now impresses the need for a holistic view we have to do many things all at once if we re actually going to make an impact which means you need to understand the full breadth of the issue i m building the case right now for eventually hiring a unit of people with expertise in gathering and analyzing data to get the whole story and give us that holistic view ricks oddie on the campaign trail with her daughter in addition to homelessness you also want to focus on health equity which became personal for you after the birth of your daughter how do you plan to tackle that issue when it comes to the issue around health equity this is actually related to black residents as well so i have been working over time with what s called the black health equity collaborative an organization born out of the framework for racial reconciliation that the city of long beach implemented right after the murder of george floyd the document was designed to make the city accountable toward its black residents it includes milestones metrics and objectives on how to engage with black residents out of that we started exploring how to tie things together to focus on communities of color we already had an office of equity we already had a health department but how do we make sure each community is getting the attention that it needs black residents need it latino residents need it our pacific islander groups need it including our samoans our tongans our chamorro population who are barely even a blip in the data they re never disaggregated out i talked to several of them when i was knocking on doors campaigning and they said they don t even feel visible most of the time at the city level so when we talk about health equity it s about being intentional about those communities that have been marginalized historically and don t even get a voice at the city level and really engaging them with them to uplift their voices and their needs there s a lot of work to do can you also talk about your efforts to expose underrepresented minority urm middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science stephanie reyes tuccio is the assistant vice chancellor for uci s center for educational partnerships cfep which has a group of managers under her that focus on urm students so statistics professor veronica berrocal and i participated in one of their workshops for students in the long beach paramount and compton school districts we did a presentation talking about statistics and what you can do with it and we recruited some students of color from the department of statistics to share their experiences i ve done a couple of presentations with veronica through the cfep talking about the work we do and trying to collaborate with them on projects so ics can be a partner in general but it s interesting because when talking about careers this isn t a pipeline problem it s a recruitment problem we need to better target urm student blocks and expose them to open positions i m a black woman so i have a much more diverse network but you have to be intentional about building a network that is diverse enough to attract the best candidate don t tell me there s no black people or latino people for a position they re out there what are we doing to find them this relates to your icts black thriving initiative strategic plan can you tell us about that after george floyd s murder icts the institute for clinical and translational science started a working group that fall a visioning process about how icts could join with uci s black thriving initiative bti we were trying to assess how we could leverage the resources at icts to double down on our commitment to diversity and make sure we were doing our due diligence to increase the diversity of the clinical translational sciences because historically as much work as it does icts as an entity has not been super diverse again it s just levels of intentionality so we drafted what i think is a comprehensive plan that leverages our strengths and talks about regional partnerships we came up with a series of goals metrics and objectives that map to the three pillars of bti leverage the mission change the culture and engage black communities that was fall of 2020 so how s it going it s been really great we ve been engaging with our education unit to get them to increase the number of nih diversity supplements contacting eligible researchers we ve had a lot of success with that over the last couple of years going from around two supplement applications to six with i think five out of those six being awarded we re also making sure our labs and research groups have culturally competent researchers so when students of color come in they have a sense of belonging and feel comfortable it s all these little interventions you need to do along the way to make things easier and more inclusive we also have a steering committee for the icts that meets every week and we have speakers come in quarterly to talk about different topics related to dei diversity equity and inclusion such as race as a biological versus social construct because race is often controlled and included in analyses and most people don t really know why they include race so we re teaching researchers to critically think about those things or we ve talked about precision of language we had a researcher dr monica mclemore of the university of washington talk about how people use words like equity diversity and inclusion and conflate all these terms without really understanding what they mean we ve also had people talk about workforce development in the clinical space to not only recruit a diverse set of students and faculty but also to think about our clinical trials because we re often testing things on a very specific group demographic we found out the problems of that during the pandemic i don t know if you heard about what happened with the pulse oximeters for measuring your blood oxygen levels but research has shown that the darker your skin the poorer the reading black people with darker skin would go into the emergency room saying i can t breathe but the pulse oximeter reading would say you re at 100 oxygen saturation so the doctors would say you re fine because the finger oximeter couldn t read through darker skin these are things we need to think about during clinical trials when we re testing devices the color of someone s skin matters this ties back into the question of what kind of data you re getting and whether you re getting the full picture from that data on that note and given that it s black history month is there something you d like to share as a source of inspiration there s a book called black like me it s old it s literally like a 50 year old book originally published in 1960 but it s basically the true story of a gentleman a journalist who s white john howard griffin who darkens his skin and then goes to live in the south as a black man it is a fantastic book because you re still the same person but once you remove the privilege of your skin the author experienced what it is like to live through the lens of not having the privilege of whiteness i remember reading that book back when i was maybe in high school and it s a great read and i still remember it to this day anything else you d like to add if there s anyone out there who s interested in the work i m doing on city council or who wants to be a resource or to bend joni s ear on an issue let me know there s going to be times when i m looking for subject matter expertise in particular areas obviously i talk about homelessness but there s tons of things that cities as large as long beach have to address so i d love to be able to interface with my colleagues here at uci and use them to get subject matter information to myself and my colleagues so please reach out shani murray uc irvine alumni paul and jo butterworth

strategy lead at snap inc uses airflow python git and bigquery machine learning matt weiss who is a data science manager at meta shared more holistic advice on building good mlops think of the whole

half of the discussion concluded with panelists sharing some mistakes they made in the workplace and the lessons they learned from those mistakes weiss in particular talked about an instance in which he analyzed and interpreted data based on his own assumptions without consulting his colleagues if you are creating anything make sure to check against something that s already been solved said weiss don t make assumptions and find the source of truth if you re trying to re create something you may have some big things you missed career developmentnooravi detailed the challenges she experienced when transitioning to her first career after college at her first job noovari was the youngest and only female employee on her team and several of her colleagues had ph d degrees or had more work experience than her leading her to feel and be isolated and have imposter syndrome i had managers who were very supportive i had friends who were very supportive noovari said explaining that her support system helped her overcome difficulties at work she also highlighted the importance of diversity in the technology industry sharing a time when she was asked to speak on a panel at a conference that typically only invited male speakers the conference later developed an all woman panel peach then asked the panelists several questions about what they wished they had done early on in their career and to give the audience advice on how to succeed in new roles weiss said taking big swings by making high impact decisions is a powerful way to move forward and talucci suggested asking for help when you need it and documenting processes especially when you re new anywhere i do this every time i m new to a job being able to document all the processes that you re going through is always helpful talucci said giving examples such as tracking failures taking screenshots and more to put in your documentation level setting according to noovari is another important skill that helps when working in teams or with stakeholders what i tend to do is err on the side of over communicating noovari said which she explains is a good strategy when being given requests with unrealistic deadlines because stakeholders better understand where she is in the process and can shift their expectations it s when they don t know what s going on is when i think issues come up the last major question of the night was what hard or soft skills will help people level up in their career intellectual curiosity weiss said specifically in my world i look for who can take the question and build the biggest impact and influence with their insights someone who s willing to go the extra mile but be able to really formulate everything from start to finish so they can sell it noovari emphasized developing your communication skills noting that this is not limited to verbal communication like speaking up in meetings i have a lot of introverts on my team and i tell them if it s a zoom call just add things in the chat they can be really good at communication via email written communication can be very strong and offset them not speaking up in meetings noovari said so being an introvert isn t a bad thing it s actually just finding a medium in which you can exercise your skills karen phan student creativity and innovation take center stage at hack at uci 2023faculty spotlight veronica

veronica berrocal tried to convince herself that she did not want to follow in her father s footsteps and study statistics today that young girl from italy is a professor of statistics at uc irvine s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics she has been named a fellow of the american statistical association asa for research in spatial and spatio temporal statistics and applications to atmospheric and environmental sciences and environmental epidemiology she has served as chair of the section in environmental sciences envibayes of the international society of bayesian analysis isba and she has advised the environmental protection agency epa sharing her statistical expertise on scientific advisory panels learn here what finally drew her to the field after years of resistance and how she s now sharing her passion for statistics with others illustrating its impact and importance how did you first become interested in statistics my dad studied statistics but when i was younger i didn t want to do what my dad did when i was in high school and considering what to study at the university i was very undecided my mom suggested that i study math since i really liked it and math has a large number of applications i remember her mentioning atmospheric sciences and weather forecasting so i decided on math stayed clear of anything that had to do with probability or statistics and ended up specializing in differential geometry after getting my b s and m s degrees in math i came to the u s to michigan state university on a scholarship to do research as part of this research i had to learn genetics and how to model genetics data since i did not know statistics i had to take some classes but ones offered not by the department of statistics and probability but by the department of animal science where i was conducting my research i started to take these classes with the goal of developing a model to identify ways to maximize animal production although the statistical topics were interesting i was not really satisfied with the application and the focus on animal production so i decided to take classes from the department of statistics and probability and get a master s in statistics as i did that i got more and more into it and that s how i found myself wanting to go for a ph d so that s how it all started it s funny because i actually ended up following in my dad s footsteps can you talk about how your work blends the fields of statistics and environmental science the environment and environmental science were things i was always interested in even though i didn t grow up in a family of people who typically go hiking camping or anything like that i was interested in animals and i ve always wanted to advocate for the weaker links seeing animals get mistreated trees get cut down or a piece of land get urbanized has always made me sad so i ve always been interested in environmental conservation and when i applied to the ph d program at the university of washington i saw on the webpage of my advisor adrian raftery a project that excited me he wanted to estimate the size of the whale population specifically the bowhead whale the whaling commission needed to establish the quota of whales that could be hunted per year so they needed to have an idea of how many whales there were in the wild that s not easy to determine as one needs to estimate the size of the population based on what one sees occasionally when i went to visit the department though i was told that the funding for the project was over i still ended up going there for my ph d and working with adrian on a project related to atmospheric sciences and weather as my mom predicted years before from there i got interested in developing and applying statistical methods to answer questions in atmospheric sciences e g weather climate air pollution so i ve been interested in this particular area of science for a long time of course now with the threats connected to climate change becoming more and more evident people are very interested in environmental science research in connection to human health and sustainability as well what projects are you working on i ve spent a considerable amount of time working on projects related to air pollution that was something i started to work on during my postdoc and i m still working on it in fact i m collaborating with jun wu here at uci on a couple of projects that are focused on estimating air pollution levels in california and quantifying the effect of wildfires particularly on pregnant women i have also recently been invited to be part of an advisory panel that will be reviewing a tool the epa has developed called ejscreen the tool lets you map and compare exposure to various environmental risk factors across space air pollution is of course one of the environmental risk factors that poses a threat to human health more recently i ve become interested in climate change not only for its effects on human health or natural habitats but also in terms of agricultural production at this point despite the climate disinformation campaign i hope everybody understands that the climate is changing and that global warming is real for me even though i know that addressing climate change requires making country level political decisions across the globe especially by the countries that are the biggest polluters i realized that i want to contribute to research on climate change more on the front of mitigation what can we do to mitigate the effects of climate change you re also helping expose underrepresented minority middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science can you talk a bit about those efforts i ve been thinking about the issue of diversity in statistics for a long time in part because i am mixed race and i never completely felt at ease in certain environments so i always think about how it feels to be a student in a field where you don t see many other people like you or you don t recognize your experience in the experience of your peers the only way things can change is if we increase the number of students and faculty from diverse backgrounds there is a lot of effort in trying to recruit students into the graduate program but i think we need to start a little bit earlier for some disciplines it s easy for students to think i want to become a doctor or i want to be an engineer because people are familiar with these careers but if you re not around people who are familiar with the department of statistics or the school of ics you might not really know about data science as i was thinking about how we might reach middle or high school students i talked to joni ricks oddie director of uci s center for statistical consulting joni had a connection with uci s center for educational partnerships cfep and she introduced me to the group we did our first panel discussion together with high school students from orange county after that first event i did other presentations with cfep i really enjoy talking to these kids and hope they will consider going to college for data science and maybe even grad school but even just getting them into data science as an undergraduate is a win there needs to be more outreach to put statistics and data science on the map for people as i gave these presentations i realized that many high school students don t know what data science is or what type of jobs one could do with a degree in data science many high school students also don t know what a professor does besides teaching you also did a seminar series on data science careers correct two years ago i got an ics inspiration award and i organized a seminar series on career paths that was meant to help graduate students because of the pandemic the seminars were all hosted on zoom despite not being in person i managed to invite people from different sectors so that they could give graduate students an idea of the types of careers they could pursue after completing either their master s or ph d degree with the seminars i also wanted to help take away the anxiety that students often have of thinking i have to figure out my life completely once i get my degree or i m stuck in a certain career for the rest of my life i wanted students to know that there are many different paths that one can construct our first speaker violeta hennessey works at paramount pictures she got her ph d in biostatistics at md anderson and is now the director of paramount s digital archives and analytics another speaker luke bornn used to be the vice president of strategy and analytics for an nba team and now is co founder of a sports analytics company but he started as a professor we also had speakers in more traditional careers a data scientist who works at google a director of biostatistics within a pharmaceutical company a professor focused mostly on statistical education and a researcher who works in a government lab all the speakers talked about how they built their career and what types of problems or projects they typically work on students really liked it anyone interested in viewing the seminars can contact me how has public awareness around statistics changed since you first entered the field i can definitely say that even though i have only been a faculty member for 13 or 14 years i can see the impact of statistics on public discourse i remember when i was still an assistant professor at the university of michigan and i got invited as an ad hoc member to join advisory panels i would often be the only statistician on the panel the rest of the panel was composed of toxicologists and environmental health scientists now i get emails where the epa explicitly states that they are looking for people with biostatistics or statistics expertise to serve on this or that advisory panel and i think that s true for many other advisory panels more and more the importance of statistics is being recognized and statisticians are getting more involved in the public discourse i think this really speaks to the impact of statistics it s women s history month any women in stem trailblazers you want to spotlight keeping it close to the areas of statistics that i work in there are two women that i would like to highlight francesca dominici from harvard university was among the first statisticians to work on studies that assess the impact of air pollution on health using very large population level studies she has contributed to evidence on the adverse health effects of air pollution and her work continues to have enormous impact i really look up to her also anybody who works in bayesian statistics and spatial and environmental epidemiology knows sylvia richardson her work on bayesian computation mcmc and on spatial modeling are part of fundamental knowledge for anybody who works in spatial epidemiology from a bayesian perspective our own department of statistics also has two trailblazers jessica utts and annie qu jessica s impact on statistical education is long lasting thousands of students have learned statistics in their undergraduate classes using one of jessica s books and annie s research breadth and contribution to statistics are quite hard to match i don t think there are many statisticians who have never encountered her name on a statistical paper seen her name on the program of a statistical conference or seen her give a presentation so we don t have to go far to find inspiring women shani murray mds

emily truong moves to the rhythm of algorithms march 16 2023 as a dancer fourth year honors student emily truong has seen countless injuries around her she wanted to study dance and biology on a pre medicine track and become a doctor however after exploring the field of data science truong learned about the large scale impact she can make on the healthcare industry through data and was inspired to double major in dance and data science during my first year i took all these math classes and i was looking into which pathways use a lot of math says truong she also shadowed data scientists at a financial technology firm and self taught herself python the summer before college i thought data science could be an interesting pathway to go through so i started taking some data science classes and realized that i really liked it truong shared that her experience of touring uci was memorable and unique compared to other schools she toured which is one of the reasons she decided to attend uci one thing i remembered about uci was my campus tour guide said that uci was the first school to reverse boil an egg she says i thought uci was really pretty and calm truong is also minoring in bioinformatics and says research is a big part of her time at uci research is how she blends her passion for medicine with data since her second year truong has worked with health researchers as a research assistant in informatics professor kai zheng s lab she is also a student manager and supervises fellow student researchers in the lab she is especially proud of a yearlong study she worked on that examined pre and post covid 19 opioid overdoses which will be published and presented in april at the uc real world evidence conference currently truong is working with uci health s all of us database to gather information on patient recruitment in clinical trials join clubs and organizations a lot of research positions are passed down that way networking is also really important she says adding that contacting professors directly and reading emails from the ics student affairs office are other ways to find openings in research labs outside of her data science classes and research at uci truong is part of the engineering fraternity theta tau where she created a gesture controlled automated curtain with her fraternity brothers this past summer she interned at kaiser permanente and worked with data on hypertension heart attack and stroke outcomes and suicide prevention truong has spent the second half of her college career focused on research and learning more about data science to prepare herself for a career in data science her double major in dance and data science helps her balance the stress and demands of her math and computer science classes because she enjoys the creativity stimulation and exercise in her dance classes after i come out of computer science class i m like oh i m so tired but after i go to dance class it boosts my energy says truong it s a really nice balance when she graduates truong hopes to continue dancing recreationally many of the soft skills she applies to her research and internship experience in data science come from dancing which she has been doing since she was 5 years old she says her work ethic time management and planning skills and creativity all come from dancing one of emily s hobbies is crocheting her latest creation is this frog with a busy school schedule truong turns to a few activities and hobbies to de stress she is part of a dance team on campus called project renegade and the sorority tri delta and enjoys attending dance performances on campus to support her peers she also likes to spend time with her friends and crochet her most recent creation is a frog truong is interested in careers in data science that will allow her to influence people and improve lives at scale her internship at kaiser permanente has also inspired her to pursue a graduate degree in data science and a role in predictive analysis one of the things that brought me into data science was realizing that i could do a lot of work behind the scenes and actually impact a lot of people at once she says karen phan faculty

science for both data uci and the wider community of data enthusiasts at uci colin yee a second year data science major and vice president of community development at data uci says planning the club s inaugural datathon would not have been possible without the dedication and marketing efforts of their board members and interns since this is our first datathon we had to essentially start from scratch says yee one of the biggest challenges was securing data challenges and funding for our event we ve sent hundreds of emails and linkedin messages to different companies and organizations with a dozen at most responding back we were very glad of the sponsors and funding we were able to receive according to data uci president and third year data science major william hou the club s hard work paid off the datathon exceeded hou s expectations before it officially began our team has never put on an event like this before so there was a lot of uncertainty especially when we first started planning around whether people would actually sign up says hou we ended up not only meeting our attendance goal but actually having to waitlist some of our applicants due to capacity limitations hou also expresses excitement about successfully putting a data related spin on traditional software hackathons adding that data uci plans to host a bigger and better datathon next year data uci hopes to build a strong reputation for its collegiate datathon in the years to come in the meantime hou and yee encourage students to continue participating in datathons you have the opportunity to work in a team and analyze data from different companies and organizations says yee a datathon like this can help motivate students to learn different data related applications and to implement the skills they

establish a data science major uc irvine has been an educational leader in this growing field for close to a decade in addition to launching the major in 2015 uci recently started hosting summer programs for both high school and undergraduate students interested in data analytics and biostatistics and its socal data science program helps recruit train and dispatch a diverse workforce of stem and data science majors now the socal data science program is scaling up thanks to a 1 3 million pathways development grant from the california education learning lab the socal data science programthe socal data science program kicked off in 2022 with a three year 1 5 million grant from the national science foundation the program is a collaborative effort between faculty from uci california state university fullerton csuf and cypress college and the inaugural cohort of 32 fellows drawn from all three campuses attended a one week training bootcamp and conducted a six week research project at uci last summer professor babak shahbaba with the program welcoming 30 new fellows later this month statistics professor babak shahbaba of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics is already looking to the future as we are working with this new cohort finishing the second year we re thinking about continuity and sustainability says shahbaba the program lead at uci we don t want the program and the benefit that it provides to end when the nsf grant ends the new four year pathways development grant guarantees that the benefits will continue creating a pipeline of talentthe grant proposal titled pipe line programs for institutional pathway engagement accelerating infrastructure and education outlines ways to develop pathways and overcome equity gaps in data science learning csuf will serve as the host organization with professor jessica jaynes as project lead partnering closely with faculty from uci riverside city college rcc and rio hondo college rhc this grant will help us continue and expand our activities around data science education at the undergraduate level says shahbaba and this actually goes beyond the students it includes developing training materials and hosting workshops for instructors to build the required infrastructure the socal data science program aligns perfectly with the california learning lab s grand challenge on building critical mass for data science the learning lab wanted to establish this relationship between different tiers of academic institutes in california and we were already doing that with a uc cal state and community college says shahbaba the pipe line proposal has three overarching goals create pathways in data science between the three institutional tiers by establishing new courses and programs address equity gaps in data science education by expanding access to technology resources incorporating culturally relevant pedagogy and applying a content with context approach and support a diverse group of faculty and students in data science resulting in a robust community of data science learners the proposal doesn t extend the number of fellows 120 expected to be funded with the nsf grant rather it helps ensure other students have access to the same type of data science education outside of the program it s more about building the infrastructure to replicate the training that we ve been providing to these fellows and to scale it up says shahbaba as part of this work ics will host training workshops and an annual data science education conference helping instructors establish data science courses at community colleges and building a strong sense of community and at cal state fullerton adds shahbaba we will look into setting up a data science major and minor this creates a pipeline of talent for not only industry but for graduate programs as well we provide this program to help the students but also it helps uci in a way explains shahbaba two of the fellows from cal state fullerton in last year s cohort were among the 11 students accepted into uci s statistics ph d program this year so it s a two way gateway we transfer the knowledge and experience that we have developed over many years and in return we re recruiting these highly diverse skilled and motivated students pipe line thus aims to arm the next generation of data scientists with the knowledge and tools needed to tackle tomorrow s biggest challenges students well trained in data science at the undergraduate level strengthen data analytics in all industries from healthcare to transportation and support graduate level statistical research that will advance our understanding of issues ranging from disease prevention to climate change leading to novel solutions shani murray ics and engineering

students from the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics started their procession into the bren events center for the ics commencement ceremony this is the last but certainly not least of the 11 ceremonies said dean marios c papaefthymiou in his welcoming remarks to the crowd of students families and friends and esteemed faculty students at the 2023 ics commencement ceremony this celebration of the roughly 815 undergraduate degrees 160 graduate degrees and 275 professional masters degrees that ics expects to confer this year began with an inspiring rendition of the national anthem performed by aerodynamix an a capella group of uci students the class of 2023 heard from classmate nadia etemadi who spoke of her journey to becoming a software developer and from featured speaker julia white chief marketing and solutions officer at the enterprise software company sap who offered words of wisdom from her nearly 30 years in the tech industry first however provost and executive vice chancellor hal stern congratulated the students the students that we re celebrating especially many of the undergraduates had a remarkable educational experience he noted impacted by a global pandemic that changed the world in ways that nobody could have imagined he commended the students for their ability to maintain their focus on projects problem sets labs and reports and for their personal growth you ve been challenged in classes and in your conversations with your friends to accept understand and challenge different points of view said stern highlighting a core element of the college experience society needs more people with the ability to listen to give people the benefit of the doubt and to engage in civil conversation with those with whom we disagree emphasizing that commencement marks a new beginning stern challenged the students to do all the little things you can to make the world a better place and to find your passion and pursue it building on communities of supportdean marios then introduced etemadi an iranian american graduating with her master s degree in software engineering as etemadi took the stage she transported the audience back in time imagine for a moment that it s the year 2013 she started i was a nervous wreck of a 14 year old sitting in my counselor s office in selecting the last elective for her first year of high school she had to choose between woodshop or intro to computer programming she remembered calling her mom for advice ever the cautious parent she suggested computer programming i can t exactly chop my arm off with a keyboard and mouse said etemadi laughing that one decision ended up cultivating a love of programming within me she said dragging and dropping code blocks in scratch might have just been another elective course for some kids but for me it was a window into a whole new world after high school etemadi s dreams of attending an elite college came crashing down when she was rejected everywhere she applied so she found another path she attended west valley community college where she found a community of incredibly talented compassionate professors and students she went on to study computer science at uc davis where she again found a community of supportive classmates the culmination of which was a zoom graduation in her living room as a graduate student at uci her initial online connections flourished with the return to on campus learning and she collaborated with fellow graduate students and research lab members with help from her advisor andre van der hoek she developed a prototype tool that lets people edit videos to attach to bug reports now as she prepares to find a job as a software developer she looks forward to meeting yet another community of talented and supportive peers and colleagues she wishes the same for her fellow graduates advising the class of 2023 to carve out a space for themselves that builds on their unique experiences memories and communities from uci student speaker nadia etemadi and her advisor informatics professor andre van der hoek finding the constant in an ever changing worldwhite who earned her b a from stanford university and mba from harvard and who spent 20 years at microsoft before joining sap acknowledged that commencement speakers often talk of unprecedented times yet for this class of 2023 she stressed that these times are truly unprecedented she talked not only of the start of their college journey and the resilience required during the global pandemic but also of the end of their journey as they enter the workforce at the dawn of the next massive revolution in technology with artificial intelligence she assured the students that armed with a world class education they are well prepared for the challenges and opportunities that await them the bren school has prepared you with the latest technology skills the ability to think critically and hands on experiences at some of the most innovative organizations in the world she also spoke to the first generation college students who made up nearly half of the graduating class you re creating a new legacy for your family and community which is remarkable she went on to share what she has learned from her nearly 30 years of working in technology which started with launching online banking at intuit technology is always advancing but there s no technology advancement without people she compared today s angst about ai s impact on jobs to what she saw back in 2007 with the cloud revolution as she helped move companies away from their server rooms to cloud based services she recognized the importance of retraining it professionals providing opportunities for career advancement as well as for further cloud innovation humanity needs to be at the center of everything we do in technology stressed white we re so lucky to have the skills the know how to help the world run better through technology it s an awesome opportunity and a massive responsibility calling on the class of 2023 to act as values based tech minded leaders she acknowledged that it s a tumultuous time do not lose hope because today every company is a tech company retailers manufactures banks automotive companies nonprofit governments all of them are in dire need of your skills every company now competes and differentiates with technology she also acknowledged the power of ai but insisted it s still just a tool one that you will be at the forefront of guiding and harnessing she then implored the next generation of tech leaders to use their knowledge and skills to improve society prioritizing responsible and ethical development tech will always advance let your values and ethics be the constant in an ever changing world featured commencement speaker julia white of sap the strongest anteater zot to conclude the ceremony dean marios asked all of the family and friends to stand as he recognized their support in helping the students achieve this tremendous accomplishment then after this moment of gratidude he announced that it was time for the competitive part of the event it is a competition among the schools for the strongest anteater zot he explained asking for everyone to join him in three emphatic zots the class of 2023 with excitement and uci pride readily obliged zot zot zot i hear that was

instructors from all around the country arrived at uc irvine for a weeklong boot camp aimed at advancing bayesian thinking in stem bats nancy elizabeth wentzel of tennessee an assistant math professor at northeast state community college was among the bats attendees i ve told my students before that the computational power we have now has revolutionized the way we re able to approach statistical problems says wentzel who teaches an introductory course in statistics however prior to attending the bats boot camp she had only a vague understanding of bayesian statistics and the real world problems it can address having almost no experience working with realistically large data sets statistical modeling programming bayesian inference or analysis of results i ve now seen examples of all of these and been able to follow along with the big picture of what bayesian methods look like in different contexts says wentzel this will enable me to speak with more knowledge and conviction about the importance of bayesian methods to accomplish incredibly meaningful real world progress on the problems that matter most to all of us in healthcare technology and every other area of modern life bats program directors and boot camp attendees the need for new trainingthe wide range of applications for bayesian statistics from supply chain management to climate change adaptation was part of the motivation for creating the bats program there is such a need for this kind of training says statistics professor mine dogucu of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics dogucu is leading the bats program in collaboration with jingchen monika hu of vassar college and amy herring of duke university the program stems from a paper dogucu and hu wrote last year the current state of undergraduate bayesian education and recommendations for the future as outlined in the paper their review of 150 colleges across the u s revealed that only 46 offered a bayesian course and in all but four it was an elective not required course uci was one of only four that required the course for its data science major says dogucu based on the findings and with funding from a national science foundation nsf program aimed at improving undergraduate stem education dogucu hu and herring designed a program to broaden the reach of bayesian learning through instructor training we have a lot of programs designed for students says dogucu but there s very very few opportunities for faculty training after people get their ph d advancing bayesian thinking in stembats is a three tiered program for training stem instructors and for developing and disseminating learning materials that highlight the use of bayesian methods in stem fields program participants receive a stipend helping cover their time and expenses tier one of the program is the summer boot camp offered at uci this summer and on the east coast at vassar college in summer 2024 uci s boot camp attendees came from both two and four year institutions and from a variety of departments including math economics biology and public policy the weeklong program included daily lessons on bayesian inference computing and modeling put together by dogucu hu and herring ics ph d student federica zoe ricci also supported the program as a graduate student researcher tier two of the program will take place this fall with 10 instructors selected from the boot camp to develop bayesian teaching and learning materials using scientific data from their fields dogucu hu and herring will mentor the instructors and help guide curriculum development tier three will then involve having five of those 10 instructors showcase the materials at conferences and through open access publications in tier one they learn about basic statistics and in tier two we want to see how this can directly impact student outcomes with new teaching materials explains dogucu then in tier three we want this impact to reach a national audience with published papers and presentations at conferences the ultimate goal is to strengthen undergraduate level statistics education for improved scientific outcomes most importantly there are two big paradigms to approaching statistics frequentist which comes with p values and bayesian says dogucu moving forward it would be very good if instructors knew both of these methods well

the release of valorant increase its popularity and what about the popularity of high school football these are the questions 10 high school students in teams of two chose to explore during a new data science for all summer program held at uc irvine from july 10 21 2023 the students analyzed related tweets using texera an open source platform for collaborative data analytics the platform is being developed by professor chen li of the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics who led the summer program in collaboration with professor wei wang of ucla thanks to funding through the national science foundation s broadening participation in computing bpc program the two week summer camp which ran from 9 a m 4 p m on weekdays and included lunch was free to attend instructors included both uci and ucla professors and ph d students with expertise in data management data science and machine learning the goal was to leverage the texera platform in teaching students particularly those with a limited background in computing data science and machine learning techniques including basic concepts about data wrangling ml training data classification sentiment analysis and visualization one of the high school students lesley gomez says that participating in the program has inspired her to delve deeper into data science the interactive lectures and completing labs through the texera platform helped me gain a deeper understanding of data science additionally this program gave me the opportunity to enhance several essential skills including public speaking as we got to deliver presentations to high school students the creators of texera and parents she says overall the ds4all program was a great experience for me high school students in uci ics shirts with their instructors for the data science 4 all program teaching with texerathe first week li and xiaozhen liu a computer science ph d student at uci taught the students about big data preparation discussing topics such data modeling databases data cleaning data wrangling and visualization the second week ucla instructors gave lectures on machine learning ai and natural language processing throughout the program students attended lab sessions and gained hands on experience using texera for the capstone project students selected their own topic for sentiment analysis we gave them the raw tweets and they spent the first week cleaning the data says liu then they did the analysis during the second week using machine learning models on these tweets to gain some insights high school students zeina harden and vitoria mendez building a texera workflow together to analyze tweets about high school football left and discussing their workflow during their final presentation right it s amazing that these students despite their various backgrounds within one day were able to become familiar with texera and then use the system to do data wrangling and data preparation steps says li we were pretty happy to see the students learn how to use the system so quickly aside from its user friendly gui another benefit of texera is that you don t have to install any compute intensive software everything happens on the server side so you can even use an old laptop that is cheap and not very powerful says li during the program uci provided students with mac laptops and they didn t need to always have the same laptop they just needed to go to the website and log in that s the beauty of the cloud service chris rodas and lesley gomez give their presentation on their analysis of spider man no way home tweets talking about how they used logistic regression training what s nextthe program was a win win for students and faculty alike a benefit to us is the students were using our servers so they gave us a lot of good feedback about texera s usability scalability and efficiency says li which is also beneficial to our research the nsf funding for the project is for two years so li plans to host the program again next summer hopefully doubling the number of attendees to 20 he is also exploring other ways to leverage texera to introduce students to data science we need to think about how to repeat this program in a more systematic way he says summer is good because most students have free time but how else might we broaden participation the team is considering other ways to leverage texera in introducing data science to high school students or to undergraduate students who aren t majoring in a stem field we plan to organize all our materials for not only the same program next year but also possibly for some other programs says li our platform is especially useful for people who have a limited it background that s the sweet spot for us because of texera s cloud model and user friendly interface so we re pretty happy with how the program turned out shani murray summer school for stem faculty a boot camp in bayesian thinkingmandt appointed program chair for aistats

the flamingo project on data cleaning the flamingo project on data cleaning department of computer science uc irvine objective the flamingo project focuses on data cleaning i e how to deal with errors and inconsistencies in information systems as an example in many applications such as data integration commercial organizations need to collect data from various sources to conduct analysis and make decisions often the data from these different sources can have inconsistencies for instance we use first name last name ssn and birthday to identify a person however the same name e g schwarzenegger may be misspelled as swarzzengaer or other forms such errors make it more challenging to link records from different places and answer queries approximately we are developing algorithms in order to make query answering and information retrieval efficient in the presence of such inconsistencies and errors with the nsf award iis 0844574 we plan to study the following problems supporting fuzzy queries is becoming increasingly more important in applications that need to deal with a variety of data inconsistencies in structures representations or semantics many existing algorithms require an offline analysis of data sets to construct an efficient index structure to support online query processing fuzzy join queries of data sets are more time consuming due to the computational complexity the pi is studying three research problems 1 constructing high quality inverted lists for fuzzy search queries using hadoop 2 supporting fuzzy joins of large data sets using hadoop and 3 using the developed techniques to improve data quality of large collections of documents with the nsf award 1030002 we will study how to support powerful keyword search with efficient indexing structures and algorithms in a clouding computing infrastructure a main application is supporting family reunification in disasters such as the haiti earthquake check our portals for the haiti earthquake and chile earthquake the main challenge is how to use limited programming primitives in the cloud to implement index structures and search algorithms our qspeller project page for the microsoft speller

flamingo package approximate string matching release 4 1 flamingo package approximate string matching release 4 1 february 22 2012 department of computer science uc irvine contributors sattam alsubaiee ph d student alexander behm ph d student shengyue ji ph d student liang jin graduated from uc irvine in 2005 chen li faculty jiaheng lu postdoc 2006 2008 now a faculty at renmin university china yiming lu graduated from uc irvine in 2008 rares vernica ph d student back to flamingo main page getting started please refer to the flamingo getting started guide introduction this release in c includes the source code of several algorithms for approximate string matching developed at uc irvine it includes algorithms for approximate selection queries location based approximate keyword search selectivity estimation for approximate selection queries approximate queries on mixed types and others although an implementation for approximate joins is included the focus of this release is on approximate selection queries here is a brief explanation of the terms used above approximate string search given a collection of strings and a single string how to find those strings in the collection that are similar to the given string this functionality is implemented by the modules common filtertree listmerger stringmap and partenum we recommend getting started with the filtertree module for this purpose selectivity estimation for approximate string search given a collection of strings and a single string how can we estimate the number of strings that are similar to the given string this functionality is implemented in the sepia module approximate string join given two collections of strings possibly the same collection how to find those pairs of strings that are similar to each other location based approximate keyword search given a collection of spatial objects with descriptive keywords find those objects within a given spatial region that have a given set of keywords in addition the keywords don t need to match exactly but approximately this functionality is implemented by the module lbak tree there are various string similarity functions such as levenshtein distance aka the edit distance jaccard similarity cosine similarity and dice similarity the following is a description of the modules corresponding to the source directory structure common this module contains classes for supporting the following similarity functions distance measures levenshtein distance aka edit distance jaccard similarity cosine similarity dice similarity it also provides functionality for decomposing strings into grams filtertree this module provides functionality for approximate string search using an inverted list index furthermore query performance can be improved by adding filters i e partitioning the string collection into disjoint subsets according to some property e g the length of the strings the use of filters is facilitated by a hierarchical structure the filtertree in which each level in the tree corresponds to one filter we have implemented the length and charsum filter this package contains three flavors of indexes in memory indexes compressed uncompressed and a disk based index listmerger answering approximate string queries based on an inverted list index requires finding elements that occur at least t times on the inverted lists belonging to the grams in the query string t depends on the similarity metric and the similarity threshold this problem is commonly referred to as the t occurrence problem this module implements several algorithms for solving the t occurrence problem as described in efficient merging and filtering algorithms for approximate string searches chen li jiaheng lu and yiming lu icde 2008 in addition we have implemented efficient algorithms for disk based indexes mat tree mat tree is an indexing structure to support queries on data with an approximate string predicate and a numeric predicate a typical query is find employee records whose name is similar to speilberg and whose age is close to 45 the indexing structure is proposed in the following paper indexing mixed types for approximate retrieval liang jin nick koudas chen li anthony k h tung vldb 2005 trondheim norway sepia this technique solves the problem of estimating the selectivity of an approximate string predicate it can answer questions such as from a collection of strings how many of them have an edit distance within 3 to a given string such information can be used in optimizing queries of approximate string matching the technique was published in the paper selectivity estimation for fuzzy string predicates in large data sets liang jin and chen li vldb 2005 trondheim norway stringmap this algorithm maps strings from the edit distance metric space to a high dimensional euclidean space and uses a multi dimensional indexing structure to answer approximate queries the algorithm is published in the paper efficient record linkage in large data sets by liang jin chen li and sharad mehrotra in 8th international conference on database systems for advanced applications dasfaa 2003 kyoto japan partenum this algorithm is published in the paper efficient exact set similarity joins arvind arasu venkatesh ganti raghav kaushik vldb 2006 we implemented the algorithm to support approximate string matching queries excluding approximate joins topk this package contains algorithms for efficient top k approximate string search lbak tree this module implements location based approximate keyword search as described in supporting location based approximate keyword search by sattam alsubaiee alexander behm and chen li it enhances an r tree with inverted indexes for approximate selection queries it implements various algorithms for choosing r tree nodes to place inverted indexes in the filtertree module is used to provide the inverted indexes for approximate selection queries in addition we have provided some commonly used functions in the util directory changes in version 4 1 compared to version 4 0 added support for damerau levenshtein distance edit distance also allowing swapping of two adjacent characters compilation warning fixes for osx submitted by jim apple from on time systems thanks a lot jim fixed 64 bit issues in lbak tree bibtex misc misc flamingo4 1 2010 author alexander

inclusion of types in dbmss postgres paper introduction slides march 31st april 5th data models query languages temporal data the concept of time is critical in almost all database applications after all databases store the entities in the physical world which is constantly evolving yet basic sql does not include any specific ways of querying over time ideally we would like to be able to be able to query to be run on any snapshot of time not just the current time e g we should be able to ask a query what was the average age of employees at uci last year and not just what is the average age of the employees at uci which is essentially interpreted as a query on the database state right now after all the database has associated with it a concept of a log which stores the whole history of the evolution of the data so logically we should be able to query the database for any instance of time these set of papers will highlight some of the finest progress and ideas in thinking reasoning and support the notion of time in databases we will explore query languages data models representation and also look at some of the implication of representing time in databases the papers we will read

14th representing managing streaming data streaming data management systems change the traditional paradigm of data management wherein data is mostly static and queries dynamically arrive in streaming data systems the queries are expected to be static also known as continuous queries and data arrives dynamically streaming data is not a new concept e g pub sub systems and event processing systems of the past and present have similar characteristics many of the technologies query languages processing mechanisms etc can and have been borrowed in building stream management systems stream data management systems extend the above work in variety of ways more complex query languages which are more expressive compared to say languages supported by pub sub systems new processing optimization techniques new approaches to load management e g load shedding as a mechanism to achieve cost versus quality tradeoff approximation as a mechanism to achieve scalability etc most work on stream data management has been driven from applications such as network monitoring complex analysis on event oriented information and continuous monitoring in adhoc sensor networks in the context of sensor data additional design constraints of sensor battery preservation has also been extensively studied techniques such as cost quality tradeoffs and in network processing of queries have been explored our goal in this class is to explore the area of stream data management from the perspective of data model and query languages specifically what types of queries are important over streaming data and how

cypress home people publications events videos and demos for members cypress dependability techniques for instrumented cyber physical spaces the cypress cyber physical resilliance and sustainability project explores techniques for dependability resilience and sustainability in cyberphysical spaces the project derives its name from the cypress tree that represents durability and sustainability advances in sensing embedded computing and communication technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to add intelligence into physical systems and enable the creation of instrumented cyber physical spaces icpss example critical infrastructures include airports energy distribution networks and organizations such as schools and hospitals example critical applications range from surveillance to security and situation aware emergency response for icpss to transform our lives through new functionality robustness and efficiency they must provide dependable infrastructure components in the presence of failures and disruptions and generate dependable information in the face of errors in sensing communications and computations dynamic adaptability of large icpss that employ heterogeneous sensing and actuation technologies becomes the fundamental enabler for dependable icpss dependability as defined by the ifip 10 4 working group on dependable computing and fault tolerance refers to the trustworthiness of computing systems that allows reliance to be justifiably placed on the services it delivers dependability constitutes a variety of non functional requirements including availability reliability maintainability safety and integrity in the context of icps dependability can broadly be classified at two interdependent levels that combined can provide a trustworthy platform for building applications infrastructure dependability how dependable are the underlying infrastructure components e g sensors networks actuators computing storage elements software environments in the presence of diverse failures that may lead to disruptions and information dependability how dependable is the information generated by the underlying infrastructure given errors uncertainty in sensor readings and data analysis mechanisms in this project we are expoiting an observe analyze adapt oaa architecture in which an icps has a model of itself its objectives and its effects on the environment the icps achieves dependability objectives through adaptation using runtime application of formal analysis methods the proposed dependability techniques are cross layer in nature and range from combining multiple networking and messaging technologies to adaptive sensing and information fusion figure 1 illustrates our approach to designing icps management software using oaa approach where a self observing introspecting system will initiate a logical adaptation of its components to meet dependability needs icps systems and devices designed using a cross layer architecture supply dynamic streams of information that are used by application which in turn adapt the usage and execution of the infrastructure since icps systems are dynamic observation and monitoring of a system and its evolution is critical to enabling dependability at the heart of the system is the icps statedb that implements the observe aspect of the oaa cycle a formal modeling and reasoning component allows for concrete specification of the icps system and analyzes the current system state to reason about the dependability properties providing a limited but focused analyze component in the oaa cycle the outcome of the analysis will help us generate adaptations that comply with dependability constraints the adaptation component makes changes to deal with dynamics in the environment implements human driven changes by embedding human activities and human in the loop decisions and deploys the logical adaptations into the physical icps infrastructure a key feature of our approach see right side of figure 2 is the ability to perform cross layer analysis and adaptation both vertically i e across abstraction layers ranging from the application to middleware os and hardware and horizontally across geographically distributed components interconnected via multiple heterogeneous networks thus oaa at the infrastructure level enables stability of the entire operational infrastructure the proposed effort focuses on system level techniques for dependable cps operation human interactions occur via applications that specify their dependability needs there are four main research tasks included in our project 1 dependable cross layer observation and state management 2 formal methods for cps system dependability analysis 3 adaptations to support infrastructure dependability 4 adaptations to support information dependability research task 1 corresponds to the observe step in oaa in this task we will generate a cross layer specification of the underlying system its abilities and application dependability needs using quantitative and qualitative analysis and design an icps state capture service for the analyze step we use lightweight formal methods to analyze the current state of the system given an infrastructure and application to determine violations of dependability needs task 2 finally the adapt step is investigated in research tasks 3 and 4 where adaptations are designed to enhance infrastructure and information dependability we aim to develop 1 an array of specific cross layer adaptation techniques to support infrastructure and information dependability in icpss using the oaa paradigm 2 a formal modeling framework supporting executable formal models to maintain runtime system models and formal analysis techniques to guide the adaptation process and 3 the incorporation of 1 and 2 into middleware services that provide dependability aware icps state management and adaptation responsphere i sensorium

recent news news virtual disaster cities to provide real life resilience virtual disaster cities to provide real life resilience september 16 2024 share this share on facebookshare on twittershare on linkedinshare through emailcopy permalink after a massive earthquake struck japan on march 11 2011 teachers at ukedo elementary school ordered a swift evacuation to higher ground saving the entire student body from the deadly tsunami that followed tragically students at okawa elementary school remained in the schoolyard instead of moving to a nearby hillside resulting in the loss of 74 students and 10 teachers given the enormous impact of such split second decisions how can we better prepare people to make informed choices when facing an impending disaster computer science professor nalini venkatasubramanian is exploring this question through a partnership between uc irvine and tohoku university in japan after going through the 2011 earthquake and tsunami researchers at tohoku started conducting tsunami inundation modeling so they have a huge amount of expertise in this type of planning says venkatasubramanian she and a team of researchers in uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics have their own expertise in leveraging data gathered through the internet of things iot to help protect vulnerable communities particularly older adults now the two groups of researchers are collaborating on a three year 1m grant funded through the national science foundation nsf and japan science and technology jst agency the joint nsf jst project enabling human centered digital twins for community resilience aims to apply the concept of digital twins to disaster science better analyzing the impact of natural disasters on humans and outlining real time pathways to safety protecting older adults the situation becomes even more dire when it comes to populations with specialized needs like older adults or people with disabilities says venkatasubramanian so we re focusing on leveraging data from these digital twins to reduce the vulnerabilities of older adults during a natural disaster the u s team includes computer science professor sharad mehrotra and other ics faculty remote sensing and geographic information system gis experts from boston university and experts from imagecat inc a risk management innovation company in long beach the researchers are also engaging with julie rousseau and lisa gibbs geriatric medical experts from the uci school of medicine and nursing with medical multi complexity older adults face higher morbidity and mortality during disasters around the world says rousseau with rapidly rising 65 populations japan and the u s need innovative solutions to build equitable disaster resilience for vulnerable older adults with physical and or cognitive disabilities the project involves designing tools to create disaster digital twin ddt cities that are representative of sendai in japan and southern california in the u s these cyberworld replicas will highlight both what these communities have in common as well as certain differences while southern california has a lot of continuing care facilities housing larger groups of older adults together the community structure is very different in japan where older adults are oftentimes more integrated into the general community living independently says venkatasubramanian also southern california is more likely to experience a wildfire than a tsunami these types of differences will be considered during crisis modeling building human centered digital twins researchers usually predict a disaster s impact in a very mathematical sense says venkatasubramanian for example she says they might provide a mathematical modeling of a tsunami s inundation levels indicative of the height and speed of the incoming water flow but then how she asks do we assess the impact on the broader community the goal is to create a virtual disaster city that can not only map out the effects of a disaster but also analyze the impact on specific structures and the people within those structures including data on their health and mobility needs as we saw at ukedo elementary school everyone there could move to higher ground for safety explains venkatasubramanian but what if a main bridge had collapsed what if you were home alone in a wheelchair what if you were in a skilled nursing facility hooked up to a ventilator these are the kinds of questions our virtual cities hope to answer the team is working with japanese and california agencies with expertise in disaster resilience and aging populations such as the international research institute on disaster services irides in japan stakeholder workshops will enable the team to understand the older adult disaster landscape leading to research that integrates diverse geospatial and human centric data sources into a novel information architecture to enrich and align multiresolution spatiotemporal data executes physics driven hazard simulations and simulates disaster processes and consequences in virtual disaster cities focusing on an older population modeling communities and their interactions and needs as a digital twin for disaster response is a critical application with transformative impact for social good says mehrotra such modeling will include dealing with data incompleteness and uncertainty finding methods for timely data collection and planning and centering the required human elements advancing ditial twin technology in new and important directions furthermore the team will build on lessons learned from the caredex project another effort venkatasubramanian is leading caredex is a smart space platform for securely exchanging customized care information between first responders caregivers in senior housing facilities and older adults exploring interdisciplinary data driven solutions venkatasubramanian says that the larger goal of the digital twins project is to bring together a variety of stakeholders in exploring data driven solutions you have geologists tsunami experts engineers ai specialists and computer scientists professional caregivers government officials she says all looking at the sociological and societal contexts as we explore ways to build better technology solutions she touched on this effort in february when giving a keynote talk in sendai for the international conference on big data for disaster response and management in asia and the pacific sponsored by the asian development bank which invests in building climate resilience across more than 30 countries the talk focused on emerging technologies for enabling resilient cyber human infrastructure nalini venkatasubramanian third from left outside the international research institute on disaster services irides building while attending the international conference on big data for disaster response and management in asia and the pacific such infrastructure could support a variety of populations across the globe experiencing a range of disasters from floods to wildfires although the digital twins project is looking at a very specific context we re also considering what solutions translate across the international community and plan to expand our findings more globally says venkatasubramanian we need to understand the structure of the community and its policies to simulate a variety of different scenarios to help people better prepare shani murray categories academicscomputer sciencenewsresearch tags digital twindisaster digital twindisaster sciencenalini

irvine share this share on facebookshare on twittershare on linkedinshare through emailcopy permalink abstract to optimize mobile health interventions and advance domain knowledge on intervention design it is critical to understand how the intervention effect varies over time and with contextual information this study aims to assess how a push noti cation suggesting physical activity in uences individuals step counts using data from the heartsteps micro randomized trial mrt the statistical challenges include the time varying treatments and longitudinal functional step count measurements we propose the rst semiparametric causal excursion effect model with varying coef cients to model the time varying effects within a decision point and across decision points in an mrt the proposed model incorporates double time indices to accommodate the longitudinal functional outcome enabling the assessment of time varying effect moderation by contextual variables we propose a two stage causal effect estimator that is robust against a misspeci ed high dimensional outcome regression nuisance model we establish asymptotic theory and conduct simulation studies to validate the proposed estimator our analysis provides new insights into individuals change in response pro les such as how soon a response occurs due to the activity suggestions how such changes differ by the type of suggestions received and how such changes depend on other contextual information such as being recently sedentary and the day being a weekday event information date time thursday october 24 2024 4 00

sli code gaussian process regression with time shifts classes group research publications code login code gaussian process regression with time shifts examples from the paper gpr fixed timesgpr with timeshift overview time course gene expression data sets provide important insights into dynamic aspects of biological processes such as circadian rhythms cell cycle and organ development a typical microarray time course expression data set consists of measurements taken at a relatively small number of time points e g 5 to 10 where at each time point microarray measurements are obtained on a few say 3 replicate samples there has been considerable work in recent years in bioinformatics on the development of statistical techniques for accurately inferring expression profiles from such data in the face of both measurement noise and biological variation across replicates however a source of variation that has received little attention to date is uncertainty about the precise biological time at which measurements were taken specifically replicates may be measured at the same chronological time yet could be at different stages of development due to the replicate individuals having developed at different rates although the underlying true expression profiles for each gene may be noisy we can infer time shifts for each replicate by analyzing all genes simultaneously in particular we simultaneously estimate the profile shapes using a gaussian process regression gpr model and estimate the time shifts by a maximum a posteriori optimization code this code implements a gaussian process regression gpr model with uncertainty in the independent axis in our case time zip file includes all code and the expression data used in our paper for more information on the model or its results please see our publication estimating replicate time shifts using gaussian process regression bioinformatics to appear copyright license the gaussian process with time shifting code was written by qiang liu and are copyrighted under the lesser gpl copyright c 2009 qiang liu this program is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the gnu lesser general public license as published by the free software foundation version 2 1 or later this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu lesser general public license for more details you should have received a copy of the gnu lesser general public license along with this program if not write to the free software foundation inc 59 temple place suite 330 boston ma 02111 1307 usa the authors may be contacted via email at qliu1 at uci edu changes last modified december 06 2009 at 04 42 pm bren school of information and computer science university of california irvine 
sli code mmpp classes group research publications code login code mmpp overview this code implements a markov modulated poisson process model for learning patterns of periodic activity in count based sensors and detecting aperiodic events deviations from the normal pattern we use a discrete time model in which the data are modeled as consisting of the superposition of normal behavior represented using a poisson process and event behavior consisting of increases or more rarely decreases in the number of counts observed the event behavior is captured using a markov chain model to capture the idea of event persistence allowing the model to find slight but sustained changes in activity and more accurately estimate the duration of a detected event an example is shown at right where the blue curve shows the observed counts black the estimated normal profile red bars show the estimated probability of an event at each time and the bottom most panel shows a partial ground truth of known events held out from the model for validation purposes see our relevant publications tkdd 2007 learning to detect events with markov modulated poisson processes sigkdd 2006 adaptive event detection with time varying poisson processes camsap 2007 modeling count data from multiple sensors a building occupancy model data data used in our experiments are available from the uci machine learning repository building in and out flow counts for the main entrance to a campus building freeway vehicle counts for a los angeles area freeway entrance code kdd 06 positive events only copyright all code is copyrighted and licensed under the lgpl gnu lesser general public license it comes with absolutely no warranty or guarantees of any kind last modified october 23 2009 at 11 48 pm bren school of information and computer science university of california irvine

sli code adaptive inference classes group research publications code login code adaptive inference about adaptive inference hierarchical clustering adaptive inference refers to the task of recomputing the results of an inference problem which is only slightly different from one which has already been solved it uses concepts from incremental computing in which the amount of work we expect to do to solve a problem is hopefully proportional to the amount of change in the problem from our already solved version in particular we use rake and compress trees rc trees to cache sufficient statistics of the inference process in such a way that a large fraction of them are guaranteed to be reusable no matter what small changes are made to the original graphical model including changing factors or potential functions adding or removing variables or modifying the graph connectivity for a system of n variables the sum product version of the code can update the marginal distribution of k specified variables in o k log n k time the max product version of the code keeps track of an optimal configuration of variables the mpe or map configuration and after any change which induces k changes in the optimal configuration finds all those changes in o k log n k time without the locations needing to be specified for more information please see our publications on the subject rc tree structure adaptive bayesian inference nips 2007 adaptive inference in general graphical models uai 2008 adaptive updates for map configurations with applications to bioinformatics ssp 2009 the code can be downloaded here please read the short usage and disclaimer statements that follow however using the code this code is mainly intended for educational purposes to provide a working implementation for anyone wishing to make use of the algorithms in their own work it is not optimized nor does it have the greatest of user interfaces the matlab functions given here were used in the nips 2007 publication and assume that the underlying graph is tree structured the ssp 2009 paper also used mainly tree structured graphs including hmms and the code should work for these problems as well but i haven t tried it the code includes versions for sum product computing marginal distributions and dynamic programming for optimization max product to compute sufficient statistics then selecting a configuration of the variables in the downward pass the functions corresponding to each are designated sp and mp respectively using the mex functions the algorithms involved in this work rely heavily on pointers and memory re allocation neither of which is a strong point of the matlab programming environment to make the algorithms scale in the proper way certain aspects of matlab s memory management system were bypassed this is done using mex files to directly access and change the array and cell array contents however these functions are undocumented and are not guaranteed they worked for me but may not work for you here is the disclaimer in the c files warning warning warning this mex file is not for the faint of heart it attempts to circumvent matlab s memory handling functions in order to give more efficient code and uses undocumented functions to do so it comes with no guarantees whatsoever it may not work on other versions of matlab or other platforms or even at all it may result in memory leaks segmentation faults destroy data set your computer on fire or suck it into a black hole for all i know if you do not accept these possible risks do not use this mex file if that doesn t deter you assuming you have mex properly set up see my kde toolbox page for some pointers on that subject you should be able to compile the functions using the buildmex script copyright license the adaptive inference code for matlab was written by alexander ihler and are copyrighted under the lesser gpl copyright c 2007 2008 alexander ihler this program is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the gnu lesser general public license as published by the free software foundation version 2 1 or later this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu lesser general public license for more details you should have received a copy of the gnu lesser general public license along with this program if not write to the free software foundation inc 59 temple place suite 330 boston ma 02111 1307 usa the authors may be contacted via email at ihler at alum mit edu change log last modified december 10 2009 at 08 30 pm bren school of information and computer science university of california irvine

sli projects sensor networks classes group research publications code login projects sensor networks improvements in sensing technology and wireless communications have greatly enhanced our ability to view and understand the world we live in collaborative networks of sensors can be deployed for relatively little cost gathering and reporting real time data about their locale i am interested in the estimation and information processing problems which arise in sensor networks an example graph sensor localization and message passing algorithms an important first step in many sensor deployments is to localize the sensors i e obtain estimates of each sensors position and or orientation almost equally important is to gauge the amount of uncertainty remaining in our estimates are our estimates sufficiently accurate and if not where do they need improvement self localization methods which exploit local measurements of relative position such as received signal strength or time delay between sensors are desirable to minimize cost and effort beliefs after first iteration we formulate the localization problem as an inference problem on a graphical model allowing us to apply generic inference algorithms from machine learning to estimate sensor position in particular we apply nonparametric belief propagation nbp a variant of the popular belief propagation algorithm this provides a distributed estimation process in which each sensor sends local information to its neighbors successively refining its position estimate the resulting distribution like belief functions also provide estimates of the uncertainty in position for each sensor communications cost for density estimates kd tree for density approximation in the localization problem and more generally in object tracking tasks for sensor networks sensors maintain a belief or posterior distribution about the objects state position velocity etc and must communicate these functions to exchange information a typical example is leader based tracking a particular sensor is nominated as the leader node and tracks the object until it leaves that sensors vicinity at this point the sensor hands off its leadership position to a closer sensor sending its current estimate of the state to the new leader how expensive is this hand off process for particle based filters it would seem to grow linearly with the number of samples however these samples comprise a density estimate and it is reasonable to think that the asymptotic cost should scale with the complexity of the density and perhaps with the fidelity to which it is represented we examine this problem in some detail and propose algorithms for simultaneously approximating particle based density estimates and representing those approximations efficiently for communication last modified september 16 2008 at 05 15 pm bren school of information and computer science university of california irvine 
sli projects belief propagation classes group research publications code login projects belief propagation loopy belief propagation loopy belief propagation pearl 1988 is a popular algorithm for approximate inference its popularity stems in part from its extremely effective application to channel coding first to turbo decoding and then to low density parity check ldpc codes mceliece et al 1998 while initially not well understood in recent years a host of theoretical results have been obtained which help to quantify its behavior bethe approximation bethe trees and convergence fig 1 bethe and saw trees one way to understand the behavior of loopy belief propagation in a graph g is by constructing the bethe tree of g the bethe tree is formed by unrolling g around a root node say 1 so that the root of the bethe tree corresponds to node 1 the next level corresponds to 1 s neighbors the next to their neighbors not including their parent 1 and so on figure 1 both black and red nodes if g is a tree each node will appear only once but if not each node may have many copies within the bethe tree we can create a new graphical model defined on the bethe tree where each node and edge has the same parameters as its original version in g then there is a nice relationship between inference on the bethe tree and bp in the original graph by placing the initial conditions at the bottom leaves of the bethe tree the initial message from s to t is placed incoming at any copies of t that do not have s as a parent the messages computed in the bethe tree at level i from the bottom will correspond to iteration i of bp on g and belief at the root will correspond to the belief at node 1 after h iterations of bp where h is the height of the bethe tree intuitively there is a nice connection to convergence of bp here if for any set of initial conditions the belief at the root is the same then bp must converge to a unique fixed point again intuitively this is likely to happen if the correlations among variables is weak and sufficiently weak that the dependence from level to level dies off fast enough to offset the increasing number of nodes at each level we have developed several sufficient conditions that guarantee this using mixing properties of the factors of g nips 2004 jmlr 2005 self avoiding walk trees and accuracy the self avoiding walk saw tree of a graph is a sub tree of the bethe tree figure 1 black only in essence it corresponds to the unrolling of the graph g up to the point at which each path forms a loop self avoiding is a slight misnomer since the walks forming this graph do intersect themselves but only at the terminal point it turns out that the saw tree is also closely connected to the behavior of belief propagation on g weitz 2006 and jung and shaw 2007 showed that marginalization in a binary pairwise markov random field defined on g can be performed exactly on the saw tree which suggested various approximations to exact inference corresponding to early termination of the saw tree we showed 2007 that the error incurred by belief propagation on any markov random field defined on g can also be computed via methods similar to our convergence results while the paper focuses on pairwise mrfs extension to the more general factor graph formulation is easy last modified may 17 2010 at 11 28 am bren school of information and computer science university of california irvine

sli pubs abstracts classes group research publications code login pubs abstracts probabilistic analysis of a large scale urban traffic sensor data set pdf ps hutchins ihler smythin second international workshop on knowledge discovery from sensor data 2008 real world sensor time series are often significantly noisier and more difficult to work with than the relatively clean data sets that tend to be used as the basis for experiments in many research papers in this paper we report on a large case study involving statistical data mining of over 100 million measurements from 1700 freeway traffic sensors over a period of seven months in southern california we discuss the challenges posed by the wide variety of different sensor failures and anomalies present in the data the volume and complexity of the data precludes the use of manual visualization or simple thresholding techniques to identify these anomalies we describe the application of probabilistic modeling and unsupervised learning techniques to this data set and illustrate how these approaches can successfully detect underlying systematic patterns even in the presence of substantial noise and missing data fast collapsed gibbs sampling for latent dirichlet allocation pdf ps porteous newman ihler asuncion smyth wellingin knowledge discovery and data mining kdd 2008 in this paper we introduce a novel collapsed gibbs sampling method for the widely used latent dirichlet allocation lda model our new method results in significant speedups on real world text corpora conventional gibbs sampling schemes for lda require o k operations per sample where k is the number of topics in the model our proposed method draws equivalent samples but requires on average significantly less then k operations per sample on real word corpora fastlda can be as much as 8 times faster than the standard collapsed gibbs sampler for lda no approximations are necessary and we show that our fast sampling scheme produces exactly the same results as the standard but slower sampling scheme experiments on four real world data sets demonstrate speedups for a wide range of collection sizes for the pubmed collection of over 8 million documents with a required computation time of 6 cpu months for lda our speedup of 5 7 can save 5 cpu months of computation adaptive inference in general graphical models pdf ps acar ihler mettu sumerin uncertainty in artificial intelligence uai 2008 many algorithms and applications involve repeatedly solving variations of the same inference problem for example we may want to introduce new evidence to the model or perform updates to conditional dependencies the goal of emph adaptive inference is to take advantage of what is preserved in the model and perform inference more rapidly than from scratch in this paper we describe techniques for adaptive inference on general graphs that support marginal computation and updates to the conditional probabilities and dependencies in logarithmic time we give experimental results for an implementation of our algorithm and demonstrate its potential performance benefit in the study of protein structure graphical models for statistical inference and data assimilation pdf link ihler kirshner ghil robertson smythphysica d nonlinear phenomena june 2007 in data assimilation for a system which evolves in time one combines past and current observations with a model of the dynamics of the system in order to improve the simulation of the system as well as any future predictions about it from a statistical point of view this process can be regarded as estimating many random variables which are related both spatially and temporally given observations of some of these variables typically corresponding to times past we require estimates of several others typically corresponding to future times graphical models have emerged as an effective formalism for assisting in these types of inference tasks particularly for large numbers of random variables graphical models provide a means of representing dependency structure among the variables and can provide both intuition and efficiency in estimation and other inference computations we provide an overview and introduction to graphical models and describe how they can be used to represent statistical dependency and how the resulting structure can be used to organize computation the relation between statistical inference using graphical models and optimal sequential estimation algorithms such as kalman filtering is discussed we then give several additional examples of how graphical models can be applied to climate dynamics specifically estimation using multi resolution models of large scale data sets such as satellite imagery and learning hidden markov models to capture rainfall patterns in space and time learning to detect events with markov modulated poisson processes link ihler hutchins smythacm transactions on knowledge discovery from data vol 1 issue 3 dec 2007 time series of count data occur in many different contexts including internet navigation logs freeway traffic monitoring and security logs associated with buildings in this article we describe a framework for detecting anomalous events in such data using an unsupervised learning approach normal periodic behavior is modeled via a time varying poisson process model which in turn is modulated by a hidden markov process that accounts for bursty events we outline a bayesian framework for learning the parameters of this model from count time series two large real world datasets of time series counts are used as testbeds to validate the approach consisting of freeway traffic data and logs of people entering and exiting a building we show that the proposed model is significantly more accurate at detecting known events than a more traditional threshold based technique we also describe how the model can be used to investigate different degrees of periodicity in the data including systematic day of week and time of day effects and to make inferences about different aspects of events such as number of vehicles or people involved the results indicate that the markov modulated poisson framework provides a robust and accurate framework for adaptively and autonomously learning how to separate unusual bursty events from traces of normal human activity accuracy bounds for belief propagation pdf ps ihlerin uncertainty in artificial intelligence uai 2007 the belief propagation algorithm is widely applied to perform approximate inference on arbitrary graphical models in part due to its excellent empirical properties and performance however little is known theoretically about when this algorithm will perform well using recent analysis of convergence and stability properties in belief propagation and new results on approximations in binary systems we derive a bound on the error in bp s estimates for pairwise markov random fields over discrete valued random variables our bound is relatively simple to compute and compares favorably with a previous method for bounding the accuracy of belief propagation distributed fusion in sensor networks a graphical models perspective pdf cetin chen fisher ihler moses wainwright willskyieee signal processing magazine july 2006 distributed inference methods developed for graphical models comprise a principled approach for data fusion in sensor networks the application of these methods however requires some care due to a number of issues that are particular to sensor networks chief of among these are the distributed nature of computation and deployment coupled with communications bandwidth and energy constraints typical of many sensor networks additionally information sharing in a sensor network necessarily involves approximation traditional measures of distortion are not sufficient to characterize the quality of approximation as they do not address in an explicit manner the resulting impact on inference which is at the core of many data fusion problems while both graphical models and a distributed sensor network have network structures associated with them the mapping is not one to one all of these issues complicate the mapping of a particular inference problem to a given sensor network structure indeed there may be a variety of mappings with very different characteristics with regard to computational complexity and utilization of resources nevertheless it is the case that many of the powerful distributed inference methods have a role in information fusion for sensor networks in this article we present an overview of research conducted by the authors that has sought to clarify many of the important issues at the intersection of these domains we discuss both theoretical issues and prototypical applications in addition to suggesting new lines of reasoning gibbs sampling for coupled infinite mixture models in the stick breaking representation pdf porteous ihler smyth wellingin uncertainty in artificial intelligence uai 2006 nonparametric bayesian approaches to clustering information retrieval language modeling and object recognition have recently shown great promise as a new paradigm for unsupervised data analysis most contributions have focused on the dirichlet process mixture models or extensions thereof for which efficient gibbs samplers exist in this paper we explore gibbs samplers for infinite complexity mixture models in the stick breaking representation the advantage of this representation is improved modeling flexibility for instance one can design the prior distribution over cluster sizes or couple multiple infi nite mixture models e g over time at the level of their parameters i e the dependent dirichlet process model however gibbs samplers for in finite mixture models as recently introduced in the statistics literature seem to mix poorly over cluster labels among others issues this can have the adverse effect that labels for the same cluster in coupled mixture models are mixed up we introduce additional moves in these samplers to improve mixing over cluster labels and to bring clusters into correspondence an application to modeling of storm trajectories is used to illustrate these ideas adaptive event detection with time varying poisson processes pdf ps ihler hutchins smythin knoweldge discovery and data mining kdd 2006 time series of count data are generated in many different contexts such as web access logging freeway traffic monitoring and security logs associated with buildings since this data measures the aggregated behavior of individual human beings it typically exhibits a periodicity in time on a number of scales daily weekly etc that reflects the rhythms of the underlying human activity and makes the data appear non homogeneous at the same time the data is often corrupted by a number of bursty periods of unusual behavior such as building events traffic accidents and so forth the data mining problem of finding and extracting these anomalous events is made difficult by both of these elements in this paper we describe a framework for unsupervised learning in this context based on a time varying poisson process model that can also account for anomalous events we show how the parameters of this model can be learned from count time series using statistical estimation techniques we demonstrate the utility of this model on two datasets for which we have partial ground truth in the form of known events one from freeway traffic data and another from building access data and show that the model performs significantly better than a non probabilistic threshold based technique we also describe how the model can be used to investigate different degrees of periodicity in the data including systematic day of week and time of day effects and make inferences about the detected events e g popularity or level of attendance our experimental results indicate that the proposed time varying poisson model provides a robust and accurate framework for adaptively and autonomously learning how to separate unusual bursty events from traces of normal human activity learning time intensity profiles of human activity using nonparametric bayesian models pdf ps ihler smythin neural information processing systems nips 2006 data sets that characterize human activity over time through collections of timestamped events or counts are of increasing interest in application areas as humancomputer interaction video surveillance and web data analysis we propose a non parametric bayesian framework for modeling collections of such data in particular we use a dirichlet process framework for learning a set of intensity functions corresponding to different categories which form a basis set for representing individual time periods e g several days depending on which categories the time periods are assigned to this allows the model to learn in a data driven fashion what factors are generating the observations on a particular day including for example weekday versus weekend effects or day specific effects corresponding to unique single day occurrences of unusual behavior sharing information where appropriate to obtain improved estimates of the behavior associated with each category applications to real world data sets of count data involving both vehicles and people are used to illustrate the technique loopy belief propagation convergence and effects of message errors pdf ps ihler fisher willskyjournal of machine learning research may 2005 belief propagation bp is an increasingly popular method of performing approximate inference on arbitrary graphical models at times even further approximations are required whether due to quantization of the messages or model parameters from other simplified message or model representations or from stochastic approximation methods the introduction of such errors into the bp message computations has the potential to affect the solution obtained adversely we analyze the effect resulting from message approximation under two particular measures of error and show bounds on the accumulation of errors in the system this analysis leads to convergence conditions for traditional bp message passing and both strict bounds and estimates of the resulting error in systems of approximate bp message passing nonparametric belief propagation for sensor network self calibration pdf ps ihler fisher moses willskyjournal of selected areas in communication apr 2005 automatic self localization is a critical need for the effective use of ad hoc sensor networks in military or civilian applications in general self localization involves the combination of absolute location information eg gps with relative calibration information eg distance measurements between sensors over regions of the network furthermore it is generally desirable to distribute the computational burden across the network and minimize the amount of inter sensor communication we demonstrate that the information used for sensor localization is fundamentally local with regard to the network topology and use this observation to reformulate the problem within a graphical model framework we then present and demonstrate the utility of emph nonparametric belief propagation nbp a recent generalization of particle filtering for both estimating sensor locations and representing location uncertainties nbp has the advantage that it is easily implemented in a distributed fashion admits a wide variety of statistical models and can represent multi modal uncertainty using simulations of small to moderately sized sensor networks we show that nbp may be made robust to outlier measurement errors by a simple model augmentation and that judicious message construction can result in better estimates furthermore we provide an analysis of nbp s communications requirements showing that typically only a few messages per sensor are required and that even low bit rate approximations of these messages can have little or no performance impact particle filtering under communications constraints pdf ps ihler fisher willskyin statistical signal processing ssp 2005 particle filtering is often applied to the problem of object tracking under non gaussian uncertainty however sensor networks frequently require that the implementation be local to the region of interest eventually forcing the large sample based representation to be moved among power constrained sensors we consider the problem of successive approximation i e lossy compression of each sample based density estimate in particular exploring the consequences both theoretical and empirical of several possible choices of loss function and their interpretation in terms of future errors in inference justifying their use for measuring approximations in distributed particle filtering estimating dependency and significance for high dimensional data pdf siracusa tieu ihler fisher willskyin icassp 2005 understanding the dependency structure of a set of variables is a key component in various signal processing applications which involve data association the simple task of detecting whether any dependency exists is particularly difficult when models of the data are unknown or difficult to characterize because of high dimensional measurements we review the use of nonparametric tests for characterizing dependency and how to carry out these tests with highdimensional observations in addition we present a method to assess the significance of the tests pdf ps ihlerarea exam mit 2004 we present some background and results from the body of work collectively referred to as fast multipole methods fmm these comprise a set of techniques for speeding up so called n body problems in which a potential function composed of a sum of pairwise interaction terms from n points is evaluated at an equally large number of locations we present these methods from the viewpoint of low rank block matrix approximations first discussing a heuristic block matrix approximation method 1 then moving into the analytic expansions which form the basis of both the original and new versions of the fast multipole method 2 we attempt to provide sufficient background to understand and compute all the relevant results yet present the material in sufficient generality that it is easy to understand the relationship to similar algorithms such as the fast gauss transform 3 nonparametric hypothesis tests for statistical dependency pdf ihler fisher willskyieee transactions on signal processing aug 2004 determining the structure of dependencies among a set of variables is a common task in many signal and image processing applications including multi target tracking and computer vision in this paper we present an information theoretic machine learning approach to problems of this type we cast this problem as a hypothesis test between factorizations of variables into mutually independent subsets we show that the likelihood ratio can be written as sums of two sets of kullback leibler kl divergence terms the first set captures the structure of the statistical dependencies within each hypothesis while the second set measures the details of model differences between hypotheses we then consider the case when the signal prior models are unknown so that the distributions of interest must be estimated directly from data showing that the second set of terms is asymptotically negligible and quantifying the loss in hypothesis separability when the models are completely unknown we demonstrate the utility of nonparametric estimation methods for such problems providing a general framework for determining and distinguishing between dependency structures in highly uncertain environments additionally we develop a machine learning approach for estimating lower bounds on kl divergence and mutual information from samples of high dimensional random variables for which direct density estimation is infeasible we present empirical results in the context of three prototypical applications association of signals generated by sources possessing harmonic behavior scene correspondence using video imagery and detection of coherent behavior among sets of moving objects message errors in belief propagation pdf ps ihler fisher willskyin neural information

whether from quantization or other simplified message representations or from stochastic approximation methods introducing such errors into the bp message computations has the potential to adversely affect the solution obtained we analyze this effect with respect to a particular measure of message error and show bounds on the accumulation of errors in the system this leads both to convergence

constraints pdf ps ihler fisher willskylids tech report 2601 2004 in many applications particularly power constrained sensor networks it is important to conserve the amount of data exchanged while maximizing the utility of that data for some inference task broadly this tradeoff has two major cost components the representation s size in distributed networks the communications cost and the error incurred by its use the inference cost we analyze this tradeoff for a particular problem communicating a particle based repre sentation and more generally a gaussian mixture or kernel density estimate we begin by characterizing the exact communication cost of these representations noting that it is less than might be suggested by traditional communications theory due to the invariance of the represen tation to reordering we describe the optimal lossless encoder when the generating distribution is known and pose a sub optimal encoder which still benefits from reordering invariance however lossless encoding may not be sufficient we describe one reasonable measure of error for distribution based messages and its consequences for inference in an acyclic network and propose a novel density approximation method based on kd tree multiscale representations which enables the communications cost and a bound on error to be balanced efficiently we show several empirical examples demonstrating the method s utility in collaborative distributed signal processing under bandwidth or power constraints nonparametric belief propagation pdf ps sudderth ihler freeman willskyin computer vision and pattern recognition cvpr 2003 in many applications of graphical models arising in computer vision the hidden variables of interest are most naturally specified by continuous non gaussian distributions there exist inference algorithms for discrete approximations to these continuous distributions but for the high dimensional variables typically of interest discrete inference becomes infeasible stochastic methods such as particle filters provide an appealing alternative however existing techniques fail to exploit the rich structure of the graphical models describing many vision problems drawing on ideas from regularized particle filters and belief propagation bp this paper develops a nonparametric belief propagation nbp algorithm applicable to general graphs each nbp iteration uses an efficient sampling procedure to update kernel based approximations to the true continuous likelihoods the algorithm can accomodate an extremely broad class of potential functions including nonparametric representations thus nbp extends particle filtering methods to the more general vision problems that graphical models can describe we apply the nbp algorithm to infer component interrelationships in a parts based face model allowing location and reconstruction of occluded features efficient multiscale sampling from products of gaussian mixtures pdf ps ihler sudderth freeman willskyin neural information processing systems nips 2003 the problem of approximating the product of several gaussian mixture distributions arises in a number of contexts including the nonparametric belief propagation nbp inference algorithm and the training of product of experts models this paper develops two multiscale algorithms for sampling from a product of gaussian mixtures and compares their performance to existing methods the first is a multiscale variant of previously proposed monte carlo techniques with comparable theoretical guarantees but improved empirical convergence rates the second makes use of approximate kernel density evaluation methods to construct a fast approximate sampler which is guaranteed to sample points to within a tunable parameter epsilon of their true probability we compare both multiscale samplers on a set of computational examples motivated by nbp demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods hypothesis testing over factorizations for data association pdf ps ihler fisher willskyin information processing in sensor networks ipsn 2003 the issue of data association arises frequently in sensor networks whenever multiple sensors and sources are present it may be necessary to determine which observations from different sensors correspond to the same target in highly uncertain environments one may need to determine this correspondence without the benefit of an emph a priori known joint signal sensor model this paper examines the data association problem as the more general hypothesis test between factorizations of a single learned distribution the optimal test between known distributions may be decomposed into model dependent and statistical dependence terms quantifying the cost incurred by model estimation from measurements compared to a test between known models we demonstrate how one might evaluate a two signal association test efficiently using kernel density estimation methods to model a wide class of possible distributions and show the resulting algorithm s ability to determine correspondence in uncertain conditions through a series of synthetic examples we then describe an extension of this technique to multi signal association which can be used to determine correspondence while avoiding the computationally prohibitive task of evaluating all hypotheses empirical results of the approximate approach are presented nonparametric belief propagation pdf ps sudderth ihler freeman willskylids technical report 2551 aug 2002 in applications of graphical models arising in fields such as computer vision the hidden variables of interest are most naturally specified by continuous non gaussian distributions however due to the limitations of existing inference algorithms it is often necessary to form coarse discrete approximations to such models in this paper we develop a nonparametric belief propagation nbp algorithm which uses stochastic methods to propagate kernel based approximations to the true continuous messages each nbp message update is based on an efficient sampling procedure which can accomodate an extremely broad class of potential functions allowing easy adaptation to new application areas we validate our method using comparisons to continuous bp for gaussian networks and an application to the stereo vision problem nonparametric estimators for online signature authentication pdf ps ihler fisher willskyin icassp 2001 we present extensions to our previous work in modelling dynamical processes the approach uses an information theoretic criterion for searching over subspaces of the past observations combined with a nonparametric density characterizing its relation to one step ahead prediction and uncertainty we use this methodology to model handwriting stroke data specifically signatures as a dynamical system and show that it is possible to learn a model capturing their dynamics for use either in synthesizing realistic signatures and in discriminating between signatures and forgeries even though no forgeries have been used in constructing the model this novel approach yields promising results even for small training sets maximally informative subspaces nonparametric estimation for dynamical systems pdf ps zipped ihlermaster s thesis mit aug 2000 modeling complex dynamical systems is a difficult problem with a wide range of ap plications in prediction discrimination and simulation classical stochastic models make a number of simplifying assumptions to improve tractability e g linear dynam ics gaussian uncertainty while such assumptions lead to algorithms which are both fast and optimal under the assumptions there are a great many real world problems for which these assumptions are false recently computational power has increased to the point where another method becomes feasible purely example based or non parametric models yet these are limited because their computational requirements grow exponentially with the number of variables we observe about the system for dynamical systems in which we generally observe the past this means that processes with any substantial past dependence become intractable in this thesis we present a novel dynamical system model making use of a nonparametric estimate of uncertainty with an information theoretic criterion for reducing the model s required dimension while preserving as much of the predictive power in the observations as possible to explore its behavior we apply this technique to three dynamical systems a toy nonlinear system random telegraph waves a real world time series from predictive literature santa fe laser data and a more cutting edge application on line signa ture authentication each of these examples demonstrates techniques for improving the model s performance and evidence of its effectiveness learning informative statistics a nonparametric approach pdf ps fisher ihler violain neural information processing systems nips 1999 we discuss an information theoretic approach for categorizing and modeling dynamic processes the approach can learn a compact and informative statistic which summarizes past states to predict future observations furthermore the uncertainty of the prediction is characterized nonparametrically by a joint density over the learned statistic and present observation we discuss the application of the technique to both noise driven dynamical systems and random processes sampled from a density which is conditioned on the past in the first case we show results in which both the dynamics of random walk and the statistics of the driving noise are captured in the second case we present results in which a summarizing statistic is learned on noisy random telegraph waves with differing dependencies on past states in both cases the algorithm yields a principled approach for discriminating processes with differing dynamics and or dependencies the method is grounded in ideas from information theory

sli projects graphicalmodels classes group research publications code login projects graphicalmodels graphical models graphical models are used to encode structured relationships among collections of random variables these relationships may be logical for example expressing forbidden combinations of values but most often are probabilistic expressing the relative likelihood of co occurrence these relationships are expressed as a graph in which directly related variables are connected which can then be used to simplify and automate reasoning over the full system our work has focused on several aspects of graphical models including understanding and extending variants of the popular belief propagation algorithm for inference or estimating the values of some variables given observations of others adaptive or incremental inference methods which organize calculations so that they can be efficiently reused later to rapidly find changes and update results after small modifications of the model graphical models defined over continuous valued variables for example 2 or 3 d positions in tracking learning the structure and parameters of graphical models from data belief propagation loopy belief propagation pearl 1988 is a popular algorithm for approximate inference its popularity stems in part from its extremely effective application to channel coding first to turbo decoding and then to low density parity check ldpc codes mceliece et al 1998 while initially not well understood in recent years a host of theoretical results have been obtained which help to quantify its behavior belief propagation comes in two general flavors sum product which attempts to estimate the marginal probabilities of outcomes and max product which attempts to estimate the most likely configuration of the variables convergence and accuracy of sum product fig 1 bethe and saw trees we have developed several results on the behavior of the sum product algorithm including convergence conditions and bounds on the accuracy of the resulting marginal probabilities our techniques are based on analyzing the bethe tree or computation tree of the bp algorithm at right the bethe tree is formed by unrolling the graph g around a root node say 1 so that the root of the bethe tree corresponds to node 1 the next level corresponds to 1 s neighbors the next to their neighbors not including their parent 1 and so on figure 1 both black and red nodes if g is a tree each node will appear only once but if not each node may have many copies within the bethe tree bp at level l from the bottom of the bethe tree corresponds to the lth iteration of loopy bp intuitively convergence then corresonds to mixing or decoupling of the root distribution from the initial conditions at the leaves if for any set of initial conditions the belief at the root is the same then bp must converge to a unique fixed point again intuitively this is likely to happen if the correlations among variables is weak and sufficiently weak that the dependence from level to level dies off fast enough to offset the increasing number of nodes at each level we have developed several sufficient conditions that guarantee this using mixing properties of the factors of g nips 2004 jmlr 2005 mooij kappen 2007 extended our analysis to factor graphs the accuracy of the the beliefs can be assessed using a subtree called the self avoiding walk saw tree fig 1 black nodes in essence it corresponds to the unrolling of the graph g up to the point at which each path forms a loop self avoiding is a slight misnomer since the walks forming this graph do intersect themselves but only at the terminal point marginal probability bounds can be computed by applying our convergence analysis to only this subtree reweighted sum product variants we are also very interested in so called reweighted variants of sum product which enable bounds on the normalization constant called the partition function of the distribution these bounds can be used in learning since for normalized models they correspond to the data likelihood and can also be used to produce bounds on marginal probabilities our negative tree reweighted bp work shows how tree reweighted sum product can be modified to produce a lower bound on the partition function as opposed to an upper bound the resulting algorithm generalizes the structured mean field approach reweighed max product variants reweighted approaches to optimization are a powerful tool for combinatorial search these methods are closely related to linear programming relaxations and provide both upper and lower bounds on the optimal configuration our work has developed efficient data structures to optimize and solve the resulting bounds such as the covering tree yarkony et al 2010 adaptive inference fig 2 hierarchical clustering adaptive inference describes the problem of repeatedly modifying and performing inference on a model since the sequence of models to be used are very similar to one another i e only incremental changes are made at each stage the results of previous inferential calculations can be used to compute the new results much faster than if performed from scratch we use a tree contraction process to define a hierarchical clustering of the nodes in the factor graph fig 2 this clustering then implies a partial elimination ordering on the variables in the graph the contraction process guarantees that for any change to the model only o log n computations must be recomputed our data structure can be used to incorporate arbitrary changes including model structure or observations in o log n time new marginal probabilities can be computed queried in o log n time moreover without knowing their number or position a priori we can find all changes to the optimizing configuration in o k log n time where k is the number of variables whose optimal configuration has changed continuous random variables fig 3 nbp uses gaussian mixtures to represent beliefs graphical models for discrete valued random variables are fairly well studied but continuous and non gaussian random variables are much more complex despite the fact that many real world problems consist precisely of such systems we have developed several algorithms for dealing with continuous valued distributions including nonparametric belief propagation which represents beliefs using gaussian mixture distributions and particle belief propagation which uses importance weighted samples learning graphical models one of the most important tasks in probabilistic models is their construction based on collections of data statistical learning we are interested in estimating both the structure of the model and in its parameters given a fixed structure recent emphases include using composite likelihood to improve the accuracy of the model while preserving efficiency and exploring sequential monte carlo approaches to learning last modified july 06 2010 at 10 31 pm bren

trail index page displays as previouspage trail index page nextpage except the appropriate arrow is omitted at the beginning and end of the trail and for a trail path trailindexpage markup is most often added to a group header or group footer trail index page link markup the trail index page link has the same markup as a standard link this means for example you can specify trailindexpage trailindexpage a description trail index page links can be restricted by anchors links to a specific location within a page this means you can have more than one trail on a page or start a trail from a specific location in a page trail index page trailstart trailend creating a trail before you can use a trail through a set of pages you have to create a trail index on a separate page which we will call the trail index page on that trail index page you simply create a numbered bulleted or definition list of links so every numbered or bulleted list of links implicitly creates a trail it is important that each page name link be the first item following each bullet any text or formatting in front of the page name link will exclude it from the trail if you want to format your trail list

philosophy observations in general indentation levels in the page list don t matter trails are a linear sequence of pages a page is part of the trail only if the page link immediately follows the list markup the list itself can be delineated by the use of anchors allowing for multiple lists on a page or for some list items to be excluded using the trail what makes a trail work is adding trail markup on the pages in the trail i e the pages that are listed in the bullet numbered list on the trail index page to build a trail add trail markup like trailindexpage to a page where trailindexpage is the page described above containing the bulleted list of pages in the trail pmwiki will display the trail markup with links to any previous and next pages in the trail the trail markup can be placed anywhere in a group header or footer or on a page a page can contain multiple trail markups if you are adding a trail to every page in a group consider setting the trail markup in the group header or group footer pages instead of on every individual page in your group path trail trailindexpage treats the list levels as a hierarchy and displays the path to reach the current page i e a breadcrumb trail in the example trail above the markup trailindexpage on trailpage4 would display as trailindexpage trailpage2 trailpage4 and for a trail path wiki administrators can change the trail separator of the path trail trailindexpage from the default by setting the variable trailpathsep in the config php file for instance trailpathsep will output trailindexpage trailpage2 trailpage4

the list including using a wikitrail as the source the pagelist directive then displays the pages that match the criteria using an optional template for example displaying each page name on a separate line as a link or including the entire content the pagelist directive currently does not have built in navigation markup that you can put on the pages in the list by contrast wikitrails are simply specified via links on an index page and you can put previous next navigation markup on each page the two serve very different purposes wikitrails are useful for specifying the pages in web feeds for

regular html style and class attributes html class and style attributes for tables and divisions wikistyles are only the commands between percent signs tables table directives and div division blocks allow advanced authors to incorporate the html css attributes class and style note that these attributes are not wikistyles knowledge of css is required to use them table style font style italic color

reused in later wikistyle specifications define box block bgcolor ddddff border 2px dotted blue box some sort of text box font weight bold color green some sort of text some sort of text some sort of text tip it s often a good idea to put common style definitions into group header pages so that they can be shared among multiple pages in a group or the wiki administrator can predefine styles site wide as a local customization see custom wikistyles tip use custom style definitions to associate meanings with text instead of just colors for example if warnings are to be displayed as green text set define warn green and then use warn instead of green in the document then if you later decide that warnings should be styled differently it s much easier to change the one definition than many occurrences of green in the text tip any undefined wikistyle is automatically treated as a request for a class thus pre is the same as saying class pre predefined style shortcuts pmwiki defines a number of style shortcuts text colors black white red yellow blue gray grey silver maroon green navy purple fuchsia olive lime teal aqua orange shortcut for color justification center and right images

uses wikistyles for styling text with color and other attributes pmwiki 2 0 introduced the ability to control the styling further and to even place styles on blocks a style is specified within a pair of signs and styles the text that follows as in this text is color red red color blue blue and normal black this text is red blue and normal black there are a wide number of available style properties borrowed primarily from html and css in addition an author can define a style shortcut by using the define property for example to define a style of red one can use define mystyle color red here is some mystyle red text created using a style shortcut here is some red text created using a style shortcut shortcuts can be combined with other styles including other shortcuts define lovelyred color red define likegrapefruit bgcolor yellow red this text is red red bgcolor ccc red on a grey background and lovelyred likegrapefruit red on a yellow background this text is red red on a grey background and red on a yellow background so far this is all basically the same as what was available in pmwiki 1 0 pmwiki 2 0 includes the capability to style blocks by using the apply style property specifying apply block in a wikistyle will cause that style to be applied to the entire block instead of just the text that follows this entire block apply block bgcolor yellow has a yellow background even though the wikistyle appears in the middle of the line bgcolor pink other inline non block wikistyles can appear in the middle of the line as before this entire block has a yellow background even though the wikistyle appears in the middle of the line other inline non block wikistyles can appear in the middle of the line as before this means it s now possible to do right aligned and centered text block text align right the text of this paragraph is right aligned block text align center the text of this paragraph is centered the text of this paragraph is right aligned the text of this paragraph is centered in fact pmwiki predefines right and center style shortcuts so that you can do this more simply right this is right aligned center this is centered this is right aligned this is

sli pmwiki wikifarmterminology classes group research publications code login pmwiki wikifarmterminology administrators intermediate there are many ways to configure pmwiki wikifarms and some of the documentation uses different terminology to describe the same things this page attempts to explain the terminology for terms not related to farms see glossary why is this page needed to provide a place to find the preferred terminology with definitions to explain where the term farm came from to list various terms that have been deprecated but still exist in the docs to suggest alternate terms for the deprecated ones the origins of wikifarms the term wikifarm is based on the computing term server farm which is a collection of servers that use a common infrastructure a wiki farm is nothing more than multiple wikis that share the same installation of the pmwiki software some recipe and documentation authors however began writing about wikifarms using agricultural terms such as field farmer barn crop and tractor in some cases these terms made the documentation more confusing it is suggested that documentation authors avoid the agricultural terms as tempting as they may be and keep in mind that a wiki in a wiki farm is like a server in a server farm wikis and components in a wikifarm all of the wikis in a farm are more or less the same except the home wiki is a wiki that is located in the same directory as the pmwiki software the home wiki needs special consideration because it holds the components that are shared by or affect the operation of all the wikis in the farm in particular the scripts directory the cookbook directory the pub directory the wikilib d directory it is possible to move the pmwiki software outside of the web document tree but the pub directory needs to be in a web servable directory one that can be accessed by a url authors writing about complex farm setups often have difficulty describing the components and their locations however it is probably not necessary or desirable to coin new terms for the components and their locations suggested terms wikifarm an installation where one copy of pmwiki is configured to run multiple wikis analogous to the computing phrase server farm the wikis in a farm can be configured farm wide using the farm s local farmconfig php or individually using the wiki s local config php wiki a site with it s own url and wiki d directory all of the wikis in a wiki farm are simply called wikis home wikia wiki in a farm that s located in the same directory as the pmwiki software and therefore shares the farm s cookbook and pub directories if you start with a stand alone installation and add a wiki the original wiki becomes a home wiki farm wide something available to or affecting all wikis in the farm typically this means modifying the farmconfig php file or the contents of the farm s cookbook or pub directories local something available to or affecting a specific wiki typically this means modifying the wiki s local config php file or the contents of the wiki s cookbook or pub directories pmwiki engine the software that makes pmwiki work as opposed to the content of the wiki that readers see pmwiki installation directory the directory pmwiki is installed to it contains pmwiki php and its subdirectory scripts which is used by all the wikis in the wikifarm if you do a standard single install of pmwiki it goes into this directory ambiguous terms installation directory installation of what some authors have used this to mean the directory that contains most of the shared components on a wiki farm others use it to mean a directory that has a complete standalone installation of pmwiki that is not part of a farm use pmwiki directory instead pmwiki installation this is sometimes used to indicate a process sometimes used to mean a single wiki in a farm and sometimes refers only to the shared components of a farm deprecated terms that should not be used these terms still exist in the documentation pending revisions and will live forever in the pmwiki users list archive farm directory the directory in which the home wiki lives or a directory where the shared components are stored use pmwiki directory instead field any wiki in a farm which is not the home wiki farm administrator an administrator who has access to all of the wikis in a farm particularly the home wiki use administrator instead field administrator an administrator who has access to one or more wikis in a farm but not the home wiki use administrator instead barn the place where common components are stored use pmwiki directory instead crop packaged content and customizations that can be added to a wiki see cookbook listofbundles for similar ideas use component bundles instead

setup by example cookbook wiki farm alternative a wikifarm is a collection of two or more wikis running on the same web server and sharing a set of common components the term is based on the computing phrase server farm this page provides some background information about wikifarms and describes how to turn a normal configuration into a farm by adding a wiki click here to go directly to instructions on configuring a farm there are many ways to configure wiki farms this page describes only one in an effort to make it as simple as possible for the administrator who is creating a farm for the first time this page will discuss 3 ways to organize content use wikigroups use independent wiki sites with a shared code base a farm use independent wiki sites with a complete pmwiki installation per site choosing between separate wiki sites and wikigroups why use wikigroups when you divide content between independently installed wikis i e with their own separate url it is difficult but not impossible to provide services that require access to more than one wiki for example the pmwiki search function can only search within one wiki using a farm as a way of subdividing related content is generally a bad idea a much better way to subdivide content is to use wikigroups why use separate wiki sites when content is largely unrelated and there will be little or no need for sharing the data between the sites it makes sense to divide the wikis into independently installed sites choosing between separate independent installations of pmwiki and a wikifarm once you have decided that you need a separate wiki with its own url you have two basic choices do a complete installation of pmwiki in a new directory this gives you two totally independent wikis that are completely self contained this is not a wiki farm create a wiki farm using an existing wiki as the home wiki where most of the shared pmwiki components will live the primary motivation for using a wiki farm is to reduce the amount of administrative work involved in managing several wikis in a farm most of the pmwiki code is stored in one place and is shared by all the wikis an administrator can for example upgrade to a new version of pmwiki on every wiki in the farm by simply updating the shared components in a single location from a reader s point of view there is no difference between separate self contained installations of pmwiki and separate wikis within a wikifarm each wiki in a farm is completely independent and appears as a separate web site each wiki in a farm has its own url and the urls can be in different domains can have its own look and feel by using different skins can have its own add ons or recipes from the cookbook can have its own administrator responsible for local configuration why to use independent self contained installations of pmwiki it is not a wiki farm and requires no additional administrative knowledge it s just two installations if you decide to move one of the wikis to another server you can simply copy the wiki directory structure to the second server and it will work assuming there is a web server and php in place you can run different versions of pmwiki on each wiki good for testing new versions no matter how badly you mess up one installation it doesn t affect the other why to use a wikifarm you can upgrade all wikis in your farm by simply upgrading your home wiki recipes can be shared across all wikis portions of your configuration can be shared across wikis most code is stored in one location and shared by all wikis in the farm i still can t decide if i need a farm the good news is that you don t have to decide in advance in fact the recommended procedure is to first do a normal or single installation of pmwiki use it for a while create pages and edit them get to know how to add recipes be sure to try out wikigroups they may be all you need if you choose to create a wiki farm then read on creating configuring a wikifarm prerequisites before you create a farm make sure that you have a working installation of pmwiki ready to become the home wiki for your farm all of the wikis in your farm will be on the same web server each wiki will have a unique url such as http www example com wiki1 http www example com wiki2 http another example com wiki1 and so on creating the home wiki you do have a working installation of pmwiki at this point don t you that s good because your existing wiki is about to become the home wiki of your farm in the directory that contains your existing wiki create the file local farmconfig php this file is used to hold any local customizations that apply across the whole farm for example you could assign an admin password in farmconfig php that will be used by all of the wikis in your farm if the url used to access your existing wiki is http www example com pmwiki then a minimal farmconfig php file would look like this php if defined pmwiki exit farmpubdirurl http www example com pmwiki pub this loads the variable farmpubdirurl with the url location of your home wiki s pub directory all of the wikis in your farm share this pub directory the pub directory holds skin definitions and gui edit buttons to be shared by all the wikis in the farm amazing as it may sound this completes all of the changes you need to make in order to turn your existing wiki into the home wiki of your farm creating an additional wiki in your farm 1 create a directory to hold the new wiki this directory must be web accessible just like the directory that holds your home wiki 2 create a file called index php in the directory with the following contents php include once path to pmwiki php this allows your new wiki to share the pmwiki code stored in your home wiki the path to pmwiki php is the file path to pmwiki php in your home wiki use an absolute file path home username pmwiki pmwiki php or a relative file path pmwiki pmwiki php do not use a url path there should not be an http in it anywhere for a web server running under windows you need to use a complete file path as in c apache group apache2 www mynewwiki 3 open a web browser and browse the url of the new wiki this will be a web address starting with http pmwiki will attempt to automatically create a writable wiki d directory where the wiki s pages will be stored if you see an error message follow the instructions if you choose the option for a slightly more secure installation be sure to execute both commands your new wiki is now set up and your farm now contains 2 wikis to add more wikis just repeat these 3 steps customization each wiki in a farm inherits the settings stored in farmconfig php do any customization that you want to apply farm wide to all the wikis in farmconfig php create a local directory within each wiki s directory to hold local customizations that apply only to that wiki you should at least create the local config php file with a new title like so php if defined pmwiki exit title of your farmed wiki wikititle new wiki farm wide customizations are processed before the individual wiki local customizations the pmwiki variable farmd points to the directory in which pmwiki php is installed and your home wiki and it is used as a prefix to allow the other wikis to share pmwiki components for example farmd scripts points to the shared scripts directory farmd pub points to the shared pub directory farmd cookbook points to the shared cookbook directory any cookbook scripts you include in farmconfig php must be included with a line such as include once farmd cookbook scriptfile php note the double quotes single quotes may work for per farm inclusions but they will not work for farmd password use authorization on farm wikis how come when i switch to another wiki within a farm i keep my same authorization pmwiki uses php sessions to keep track of authentication authorization information and by default php sets things up such that all interactions with the same server are considered part of the same session an easy way to fix this is to make sure each wiki is using a different cookie name for its session identifier near the top of one of the wiki s local config php files before calling authuser or any other recipes add a line like session name xyzsessid you can pick any alphanumeric name for xyzsessid for example for the cs559 1 wiki you might choose session name cs559sessid this will keep the two wikis sessions independent of each other notes the terminology used to describe wiki farms is not used consistently see wikifarmterminology for more info it is important to remember that not all of the recipes in the cookbook have been written for or tested with farms be sure to look for instructions on how to use a recipe on a farm there are many many more things you can do with farms some are described on pmwiki wikifarmsadvanced which also contains links to step by step examples of setting up a farm categories

sli pmwiki webfeeds classes group research publications code login pmwiki webfeeds site preferences documentation index wiki farms visitors intermediate web feeds are a convenient mechanism to let visitors be notified of changes to a site instead of repeatedly checking recentchanges every day to see what is new a visitor can use a news aggregator to quickly see what pages of interest have changed on a site web feeds are commonly recognized by terms such as rss atom and web syndication they are also the foundation for podcasting in its simplest form web feeds in pmwiki are built on wikitrails using a feed action such as action rss or action atom on a trail generates a web feed often called a channel where each page on the trail is an item in the feed since the recentchanges and site allrecentchanges pages are effectively trails one can easily get an rss feed for a group or site by simply adding action rss to the url for a recentchanges page for example to get the site feed for pmwiki org one would use http pmwiki org wiki site allrecentchanges action rss authors can also create custom feeds by simply creating a wiki trail of the pages they want included in the feed feeds can also be generated from groups categories and backlinks and the order and number of items in the feed can be changed using options in the feed url thus one can obtain a feed for the skins category sorted with most recent items first by using http pmwiki org wiki category skins action rss order time pmwiki is able to generate feeds in many formats including rss 2 0 action rss atom 1 0 action atom and rss 1 0 action rdf in addition although it is not normally considered a web feed pmwiki can generate metadata information using the dublin core metadata extensions action dc how to read a pmwiki syndicated feed you ll need a news aggregator which is a piece of software designed to read news feeds many different news aggregators are available some run on your own computer either on their own or as plugins for email clients web browsers or newsreaders others are web applications that you can use from any internet connected computer some are in between technically web applications but ones designed to run on your computer not some remote server get one that you like subscribe to the wikitrail you desire by supplying the feed url to the aggregator the feed url will be the name of a trail page with action rss or action atom added to the end of the url feed options add any of the following options to the end of a pmwiki web feed url to change its output basically any pagelist option is available for web feeds count n limit feed to n items default 10 order time display most recently changed items first default the order of the trail or by name in recentchanges pages the trail is already ordered by time trail page obtain items from trail on page default the trail on the current page group group limit feed to pages in group name name limit feed to pages with specific name link page create feed from pages linked to page list normal exclude things like recentchanges allrecentchanges etc authors intermediate configure pmwiki for feeds this section describes how to syndicate portions of a wiki to appear in a web feed it does not describe how to display a web feed within a wiki page for that see cookbook rssfeeddisplay to enable web feed generation for a site add one or more of the following to a local customization file if action rss include once farmd scripts feeds php if action atom include once farmd scripts feeds php if action rdf include once farmd scripts feeds php if action dc include once farmd scripts feeds php or you can combine multiple feeds into a single expression using to separate each feed type for example if you want to enable rss and atom feeds you would use if action rss action atom action rdf action dc include once farmd scripts feeds php configure feed content web feeds are highly configurable new elements can be easily added to feeds via the feedfmt array elements in feedfmt look like feedfmt atom feed rights all rights reserved where the first index corresponds to the action action atom the second index indicates a per feed or per item element and the third index is the name of the element being generated the above setting would therefore generate a rights all rights reserved rights in the feed for action atom if the value of an entry begins with a then feeds php doesn t automatically add the tag around it elements can also be callable functions which are called to generate the appropriate output see rss specification or other feed specifications for what feed content you can use you can also change an existing element rather than add a new one you can use the following lines to ensure that changes made to the wiki will be picked up by some rss readers that wouldn t otherwise notice a page has been changed change the link url when an item is edited feedfmt rss item link pageurl when itemisotime feedfmt atom item link link rel alternate href pageurl when itemisotime n see also cookbook feedlinks add html head links for auto discovery of your feeds wikitrails wikipedia web feed wikipedia web

pm yes how can i use the rss enclosure tag for podcasting for podcasting of mp3 files simply attach an mp3 file to the page with the same name as the page i e for a page named podcast episode4 one would attach to that page a file named episode4 mp3 the file is automatically picked up by action rss and used as an enclosure the set of potential enclosures is given by the rssenclosurefmt array thus rssenclosurefmt array name mp3 name wma name ogg allows podcasting in mp3 wma and ogg formats how to add summary to the title in a rss feed ie with action rss add this line in you local config php feedfmt rss item title group title lastmodifiedsummary how to add description to the title in an rss feed and summary to the body add these lines to your local config php feedfmt rss item title group title description feedfmt rss item description lastmodifiedsummary notes you need to replicate these lines for each type atom rdf dc of feed you provide the rss description tag is not equivalent to the pmwiki description variable despite the confusing similarity some of my password protected pages aren t appearing in the feed how do i work around this from a similar question on the newsgroup pm s reply the last time i checked rss and other syndication protocols didn t really have a well established interface or mechanism for performing access control i e authentication as far as i know this is still the case pmwiki s webfeeds capability is built on top of pagelists so it could simply be that the enablepagelistprotect option is preventing the updated pages from appearing in the feed you might try setting enablepagelistprotect 0 and see if the password protected pages start appearing in the rss feed the downside to setting enablepagelistprotect to zero is that anyone doing a search on your site will see the existence of the pages in the locked section they won t be able to read any of them but they ll know they are there you could also set enablepagelistprotect to zero only if action rss if action rss enablepagelistprotect 0 this limits the ability to see the protected pages to rss feeds normal pagelists and searches wouldn t see them lastly it s also possible to configure the webfeeds to obtain the authentication information from the url directly as in site allrecentchanges action rss authpw secret the big downside to this is that the cleartext password will end up traveling across the net with every rss request and may end up being recorded in apache s access logs how to add feed image add the following to local config php this example is for action rss feedfmt rss feed image title logo title title link http example com link url http example com images logo gif url width 120 width height 60 height do not forget not to start with a as there would be no image tag around this see here how do i insert rss news feeds into pmwiki pages see cookbook rssfeeddisplay how can i specify default feed options in a configuration file instead of always placing them in the url for example if you want action rss to default to action rss group news order time count 10 try the following in a local customization file if action rss sdva request array group news order time count 10 are there ways to let people easily subscribe to a feed on some browsers mozilla firefox the visitor can see an orange rss icon in the address bar and subscribe to the feed by clicking on it to enable the rss icon add this to config php htmlheaderfmt feedlinks link rel alternate type application rss xml title wikititle href scripturl n site allrecentchanges amp action rss link rel alternate type application atom xml title wikititle href scripturl n site allrecentchanges amp action atom you can also add such a link for example in your sidebar site allrecentchanges action atom subscribe to feed can i create an rss feed for individual page histories see cookbook pagefeed how do i create a custom feedpage similar to recentchanges or allrecentchanges but with only certain groups or pages recorded see cookbook customrecentchanges in a nutshell you ll declare a recentchangesfmt variable with your dedicated feedpage and then wrap it in a condition of your choice for example if pagevar pagename group forbiddengroup recentchangesfmt site myfeedpage fullname currenttime by authorlink changesummary how can i update my rss feed to show every edit for pages on that feed not just new pages added to the feed add unique guid links for each edit to your to config php file see pits entry feedfmt rss item guid pageurl guid itemisotime alternatively you can create the option for edit monitoring by adding a qualifier for rss links this allows the user to choose between default new pages rss feeds and new edits rss feeds pmwiki org has this option enabled for new pages updates http example com wiki homepage action rss for edits updates http example com wiki homepage action rss edits 1 if request edits action rss feedfmt rss item guid pageurl guid itemisotime

sli pmwiki uploads administration classes group research publications code login pmwiki uploads administration backup and restore documentation index security pmwiki includes a script called upload php that allows users to upload files to the wiki server using a web browser uploaded files also called attachments can then be easily accessed using markup within wiki pages this page describes how to install and configure the upload feature some notes about security pmwiki takes a somewhat but justifiable paranoid stance when it comes to the uploads feature thus the default settings for uploads tend to try to restrict the feature as much as possible the upload function is disabled by default even if you enable it the function is password locked by default even if you remove the password you re restricted to uploading files with certain names extensions and sizes the characters that may appear in upload filenames are default alphanumerics hyphen underscore dot and space see also here the maximum upload size is small 50k by default this way the potential damage is limited until unless the wiki administrator explicitly relaxes the restrictions keep in mind that letting users anonymously upload files to your web server does entail some amount of risk the upload php script has been designed to reduce the hazards but wiki administrators should be aware that the potential for vulnerabilities exist and that misconfiguration of the upload utility could lead to unwanted consequences by default authorized users are able to overwrite files that have already been uploaded without the possibility of restoring the previous version of the file if you want to disallow users from being able to overwrite files that have already been uploaded add the following line to config php enableuploadoverwrite 0 alternatively an administrator can keep older versions of uploads an administrator can also configure pmwiki so the password mechanism controls access to uploaded files basic installation the upload php script is automatically included from stdconfig php if the enableupload variable is true in config php in addition config php can set the uploaddir and uploadurlfmt variables to specify the local directory where uploaded files should be stored and the url that can be used to access that directory by default uploaddir and uploadurlfmt assume that uploads will be stored in a directory called uploads within the current directory usually the one containing pmwiki php in addition config php should also set a default upload password see passwordsadmin thus a basic config php for uploads might look like php if defined pmwiki exit enable uploads and set a site wide default upload password enableupload 1 uploadpermadd 0 defaultpasswords upload pmcrypt secret if you have edit passwords and wish to allow all users with edit rights to upload instead of defaultpasswords upload you can set handleauth upload edit in config php important do not create the uploads directory yet see the next paragraph you may also need to explicitly set which filesystem directory will hold uploads and provide a url that corresponds to that directory like uploaddir home foobar public html uploads uploadurlfmt http example com foobar uploads note in most installations you don t need to define or change these variables usually pmwiki can detect them and if you do uploads may simply not work upload directory configuration uploads can be configured site wide by group default or by page by changing uploadprefixfmt in config php this determines whether all uploads go in one directory for the site an individual directory for each group or an individual directory for each page the default is to organize upload by group it is recommended that the uploadprefixfmt variable defined in config php is the same for all pages in the wiki and not different in group or page local configuration files otherwise you will be unable to link to attachments in other wikigroups single upload directory for site wide uploads use uploadprefixfmt per page upload directories to organize uploads by page use uploadprefixfmt group name you may prefer uploads attached per page rather than per group or per site if you plan to have many files attached to individual pages this setting simplifies the management of picture galleries for example in a page you can always link to attachments to other pages the upload directory for the upload feature to work properly the directory given by uploaddir must be writable by the web server process and it usually must be in a location that is accessible to the web somewhere e g in a subdirectory of public html executing pmwiki with uploads enabled will prompt you with the set of steps required to create the uploads directory on your server it differs from one server to the next note that you are likely to be required to explicitly create writable group or page specific subdirectories as well uploading a file once the upload feature is enabled users can access the upload form by adding action upload to the end of a normal pmwiki url the user will be prompted for an upload password similar to the way other pages ask for passwords see passwords and passwordsadmin for information about setting passwords on pages groups and the entire site another way to access the upload form is to insert the markup attach filename ext into an existing page where filename ext is the name of a new file to be uploaded when the page is displayed a link will be added to the end of the markup to take the author to the upload page see uploads for syntax variations by default pmwiki will organize the uploaded files into separate subdirectories for each group this can be changed by modifying the uploadprefixfmt variable see cookbook uploadgroups for details versioning uploaded files pmwiki does not manage versioning of uploaded files by default however by setting enableuploadversions 1 an administrator can have older versions of uploads preserved in the uploads directory along with the most recent version upload restrictions restricting uploaded files for groups and pages uploads can be enabled only for specific groups or pages by using a group customization simply set enableupload 1 for those groups or pages where uploading is to be enabled alternately set enableupload 1 in the config php file and then set enableupload 0 in the per group or per page customization files where uploads are to be disabled restricting total upload size for a group or the whole wiki uploads can be restricted to an overall size limit for groups in the group configuration file i e local group php add the line uploadprefixquota 1000000 limit group uploads to 1000kb 1mb this will limit the total size of uploads for that group to 1000kb any upload that pushes the total over the limit will be rejected with an error message this value defaults to zero unlimited uploads can also be restricted to an overall size limit for all uploads add the line uploaddirquota 10000000 limit total uploads to 10000kb 10mb this will limit the total size of uploads for the whole wiki to 10000kb any upload that pushes the total over the limit will be rejected with an error message this value defaults to zero unlimited restricting uploaded files type and size the upload script performs a number of verifications on an uploaded file before storing it in the upload directory the basic verifications are described below filenames the name for the uploaded file can contain only letters digits underscores hyphens spaces and periods and the name must begin and end with a letter or digit file extension only files with approved extensions such as gif jpeg doc etc are allowed to be uploaded to the web server this is vitally important for server security since the web server might attempt to execute or specially process files with extensions like php cgi etc file size by default all uploads are limited to 50k bytes as specified by the uploadmaxsize variable thus to limit all uploads to 100kb simply specify a new value for uploadmaxsize in config php uploadmaxsize 100000 however the default maximum file size can also be specified for each type of file uploaded thus an administrator can restrict gif and jpeg files to 20k doc files to 200k and all others to the size given by uploadmaxsize the uploadextsize array is used to determine which file extensions are valid and the maximum upload size in bytes for each file type for example uploadextsize gif 20000 limit gif files to 20kb disabling file upload by file type setting an entry to zero disables file uploads of that type altogether uploadextsize zip 0 disallow zip files uploadextsize 0 disallow files with no extension you can limit which types of files are uploadable by disabling all defaults and specifying only desired types setting the variable uploadmaxsize to zero will disable all default file types individual file types may then be enabled by setting their maximum size with the variable uploadextsize turns off all upload extensions uploadmaxsize 0 enable only these file types for uploading asize 100000 100 kb file size limitation uploadextsize jpg asize uploadextsize gif asize uploadextsize png asize note files with multiple extensions some installations with the apache server will try to execute a file which name contains php pl or cgi even if it isn t the last part of the filename for example a file named test php txt may be executed to disallow such files to be uploaded add to config php such a line uploadblacklist array php pl cgi adding new file types to permitted uploads to add a new extension to the list of allowed upload types add a line like the following to a local customization file uploadexts ext content type where ext is the extension to be added and content type is the mime type or content type which you may find here or on the lower part of this page to be used for files with that extension for example to add the dxf extension with a content type of image x dxf place the line uploadexts dxf image x dxf each entry in uploadexts needs to be the extension and the mime type associated with that extension thus uploadexts array gif image gif jpeg image jpeg jpg image jpeg png image png xxx yyyy zzz for the types that pmwiki already knows about it s not necessary to repeat them here the upload php script adds pmwiki s defaults to whatever the administrator supplies see also cookbook uploadtypes for additional types other file size limits there are other factors involved that affect upload file sizes in apache 2 0 there is a limitrequestbody directive that controls the maximum size of anything that is posted including file uploads apache has this defaulted to unlimited size however some linux distributions e g red hat linux limit postings to 512k so this may need to be changed or increased normally these settings are in an httpd conf configuration file or in a file in etc httpd conf d problem noted on red hat 8 0 9 0 with apache 2 0 x the error requested content length of 670955 is larger than the configured limit of 524288 was occurring under apache and a page not found would appear in the browser trying the above settings made no change with php but on red hat 8 0 9 0 there is an additional php config file etc httpd conf d php conf and increasing the number on the line limitrequestbody 524288 solves the issue php itself has two limits on file uploads usually located in etc php ini the first is the upload max filesize parameter which is set to 2mb by default the second is post max size which is set to 6mb by default with the variables in place pmwiki s maximum file size apache s request size limits and the php file size parameters the maximum uploaded file size will be the smallest of the three variables password protecting uploaded files setting a read password for pages and groups will prevent an attached file from being seen or accessed through the page but to prevent direct access to the file location the uploads directory one can do the following in local config php set enabledirectdownload 0 if you use per group upload directories pmwiki default see uploadprefixfmt add to config php enableuploadgroupauth 1 deny public access to the uploads directory through moving it out of the html or public html directory tree or through a htaccess file see cookbook secure attachments other notes if uploads doesn t seem to work make sure that your php installation allows uploads the php ini file usually etc php ini or usr local lib php ini should have file uploads on another source of error in the php ini file is a not defined upload tmp dir just set this variable to your temp directory e g upload tmp dir tmp note that if you change this values httpd must generally be restarted another way to check if uploads are allowed by the server is to set enablediag to 1 in config php and set action phpinfo on a url the file uploads variable must have a value of 1 if it says no value that means it s off how do i disable uploading of a certain type of file here s an example of what to add to your local config php file to disable uploading of zip files or of files with no extension uploadextsize zip 0 disallow uploading zip files uploadextsize 0 disallow files with no extension how do i attach uploads to individual pages or

upload form upload replacement one can go directly to the upload form by appending action upload to the uri for any page that has file uploads enabled by the wiki administrator replace a file by simply uploading a new version of the file with the same name be sure to clear your browser cache after replacing an upload otherwise it may appear that the original upload is still on the server if you put enableuploadversions 1 in your local config php the old versions of the same files are renamed and not removed type and size restrictions for security reasons the upload feature is disabled when pmwiki is first installed when enabled uploads are restricted as to the types and sizes of files that may be uploaded to the server see uploads admin pmwiki s default configuration limits file sizes to 50 kilobytes and file extensions to common types such as gif jpeg doc txt and pdf in addition the administrator can configure the system to require an upload password see passwords and

instead of attach file doc use parentheses as in attach file doc there is also a configuration change that can eliminate the attach see cookbook attachlinks why can t i upload files of size more than 50kb to my newly installed pmwiki out of the box pmwiki limits the size of files to be uploaded to 50kb add uploadmaxsize 1000000 limit upload file size to 1 megabyte to your config php to increase

unexpectedly with incomplete file received you may be running out of space in a scratch area used either by pmwiki or by php on nix check that you have sufficient free space in tmp and var tmp how do i make it so that the upload link still allows one to make another upload if someone wants to replace the old version of a file with a newer version for example currently you only get the upload link when there is no file in the upload directory use the attach page action and click on the delta symbol shown against each of files listed if you can t see the attach action either uploads are not

sli pmwiki upgradingfrompmwiki1 classes group research publications code login pmwiki upgradingfrompmwiki1 this page gives suggestions for upgrading an existing pmwiki 1 x installation to use pmwiki 2 0 in this page we assume that a site administrator already has a site running using pmwiki version 1 x or earlier in a somewhat standard configuration and wants to upgrade to the 2 0 software important note the normal pmwiki upgrade procedure i e copy the new software over the existing one won t work for moving from 1 x to 2 0 either start over with a new installation or use some of the conversion scenarios listed below as always questions and requests for assistance can be posed to pmwiki users errors or problems with the methods below can be corrected here or posted to the pmwiki issue tracking system conversion because of the substantial redesign of pmwiki for 2 0 converting an existing site to 2 0 is likely to cause a wiki administrator a fair amount of apprehension the approach given here allows the administrator to install configure and test pmwiki 2 0 on an existing set of pages without risking an existing 1 x installation it shall be noted that the compatibility script being used by this method was removed in pmwiki 2 2 0beta43 you need to install pmwiki 2 2 0beta42 to carry out the migration procedure and then upgrade to the latest pmwiki version step 0 it s always a very good idea to back up your existing pmwiki 1 x installation before doing anything else especially save the files in the local and wiki d directories step 1 install pmwiki 2 0 into a new directory away from the existing 1 x installation step 2 briefly test the pmwiki 2 0 installation and make sure it is working properly i e edit and save a couple of pages then remove the pages you created you can just remove the files from pmwiki 2 0 s wiki d directory or remove the wiki d directory altogether step 3 add the following lines to the local config php file in the 2 0 installation replacing path to pmwiki1 wiki d below with the location of your pmwiki 1 x installation s wiki d directory on disk include once farmd scripts compat1x php usev1wikid path to pmwiki1 wiki d for example my 2 0 test conversion uses include once farmd scripts compat1x php usev1wikid home pmichaud pmwiki wiki d step 4 after making the above change all of your existing pages should appear in the new 2 0 installation furthermore if you edit page on any of the existing pages you should see that any pmwiki 1 x markups links etc have been converted to the new markup syntax any pages edited saved by the 2 0 wiki installation are kept separate from the pages in the previous installation thus you can safely experiment with editing and changing pages in the new site without affecting the existing 1 x site step 5 once you see that your existing pages are available in the 2 0 installation you can then begin going through the remaining initial setup tasks for the 2 0 site to enable any local customizations you may want for your site many local customizations e g page layout templates remain the same between 1 x and 2 0 others such as custom markup or cookbook recipes need to be converted to 2 0 as well note wikiword links are disabled by default since pmwiki version 2 1 beta2 so you may either enable wikiword links by setting linkwikiwords 1 in config php or convert your existing wikiword links manually to bracketed links to find those wikiword links easier you can highlight them by setting in config php htmlstylesfmt wikiword span wikiword background yellow step 6 continue configuring the new installation just as if you were setting up a new pmwiki site if you find pmwiki 1 x markups that aren t converted or convert incorrectly be sure to enter a new pits issue so that we can improve the conversion script step 7 if you re comfortable with the conversion and want to go ahead and convert all of the 1 x pages into 2 0 format change the usev1wikid call in local config php above to convertv1wikid instead as in include once farmd scripts compat1x php convertv1wikid path to pmwiki1 wiki d running the pmwiki php script will then bring up some forms to allow you to bulk migrate some or all of your 1 x pages to 2 0 format after you ve converted pages you can then just eliminate these two lines from the configuration and your pmwiki 2 0 site will be running standalone if you have local customisations that require you to specify compat1x match replace entries so they are correctly converted make sure these are defined before the call to convertv1wikid note that there s nothing that requires you to convert all of the pages or get rid of the 1 x wiki d directory pmwiki works just fine with it in place and it s good to have a backup step 8 once you re comfortable that the pmwiki 2 0 site will meet your needs you can then discontinue the 1 x site and just start using the 2 0 site or if you decide that 2 0 isn t for you then the 1 x site is still intact and can continue to be used step 9 if your previous site had an uploads directory you ll probably want to copy it or move it into the new location external link fix links in wiki pages from

sli pmwiki upgrades classes group research publications code login pmwiki upgrades initial setup tasks documentation index backup and restore pmwiki is designed to make it easy to upgrade the pmwiki software without affecting your existing data files or installation for most upgrades you simply copy the files in the new release over your existing installation note for pmwiki 1 0 sites upgrading from 1 0 x to 2 0 requires more than simply copying the 2 0 software over the 1 0 installation see upgrading from pmwiki 1 for more details contents generic instructions upgrading from version 2 1 27 to 2 2 0 upgrading from version 2 2 0 to the latest version faq generic instructions 1 read the release notes please read carefully the releasenotes before performing an upgrade about the changes between your previous version and the new one see if there are any significant changes or preparation tasks that must be handled before performing the upgrade 2 backup it s always a good idea to have a backup copy of your existing pmwiki installation before starting you can copy the entire directory containing your existing installation or you can just make copies of the wiki d directory and any other local customization files you may have created e g config php localmap txt etc 3 download and extract download the version of pmwiki that you want from the download page extract the tar image using tar xvzf tgzfile where tgzfile is the tar file you downloaded above this will create a pmwiki x y z directory with the new version of the software 4 copy copy the files in pmwiki x y z over the files of your existing pmwiki installation for example if your existing pmwiki installation is in a directory called pmwiki then one way to copy the new files over the existing ones is to enter the command cp a pmwiki x y z pmwiki note that bsd systems will not have the a option as a command line argument for cp but that s okay since it s just shorthand for cp dpr so use that instead of a some environments have an alias established for cp that enable interactive prompts before overwriting a file to work around this specify the absolute path to cp such as bin cp on some freebsd servers and mac os x systems you need to use cp rpv pmwiki x y z pmwiki 5 update customisations and recipes that s it your base pmwiki installation is complete now use the pmwiki site analyzer to determine which recipes could be updated to the most recent version unless you have made customizations to the pmwiki php script or to the files in scripts your pmwiki installation should continue to run correctly changes to these files are not recommended local customizations should go in local config php pub css and pub skins yourskinname note additional tips can be found on the pmwiki troubleshooting page upgrading from version 2 1 27 to 2 2 0 between the stable versions 2 1 27 and 2 2 0 there are a number of additions some of them may need changes to local config files or to wiki pages and they are outlined here for the full list of changes see the release notes if you are upgrading from a 2 2 beta version your wiki may already include these features some pages that were formerly in the site group are now in a separate read protected siteadmin group site authuser site authlist site notifylist site blocklist and site approvedurls if upgrading from an earlier version pmwiki will prompt to automatically copy these pages to their new location if needed if a site wishes to continue using the old site group for these pages simply set to config php siteadmingroup sitegroup to authorize reading or editing in protected areas the former password nopass should now be written as nopass wikiwords are now disabled by default to re enable them set either linkwikiwords or enablewikiwords to 1 the rospatterns variable has changed replacement strings are no longer passed through fmtpagename i e it must now be done explicitly page links inside included pages sidebars headers or footers are now treated as relative to the page where they are written instead of the page where they appear for example in site sidebar always set the group in a wikilink like main homepage or with a page variable group homepage because a link homepage will point to a page site homepage pagelists spaces no longer separate wildcard patterns use commas pagecount groupcount grouppagecount variables used in pagelist templates are now pagecount groupcount grouppagecount the directive no longer accepts parameters from urls by default in order to have it accept such parameters which was the default in 2 1 and earlier add a request 1 option to the pagelist directive skin templates are now required to have htmlheader and htmlfooter directives authentication using active directory is now simplified see pmwiki authuser upgrading from version 2 2 0 to the latest version note this page may have a more recent version see pmwiki upgrades some additions since version 2 2 0 may need changes to local config

pagevariables from included pages sidebars headers and footers the form var refers to the currently browsed page while var without an asterisk refers to the physical page where the pagevar is written

site editform site pagenotfound sidebar pages groupheaderfmt groupfooterfmt page lists in sidebars headers and footers see special references if your wiki heavily relies on the previous behavior you can revert to it see enablerelativepagevars version 2 2 35 important change for international wikis the xlpage function no longer loads encoding scripts such as xlpage utf 8 php when you upgrade you need to include those scripts from config php before the call to xlpage include once scripts xlpage utf 8 php if your wiki uses utf 8 xlpage bg pmwikibg xlpage faq how can i determine what version of pmwiki i m running now see version determining and displaying the current version of pmwiki pmwiki 2 2 93 how can i test a new version of pmwiki on my wiki without changing the prior version used by visitors the easy way to do this is to install the new version in a separate directory and for the new version set in local config php wikilibdirs array wikidir new pagestore path to existing wiki d fullname new pagestore wikilib d fullname this lets you test the new version using existing page content without impacting the existing site or risking modification of the pages of course any recipes or local customizations have to be installed in the new version as well then once you re comfortable that the new version seems to work as well as the old it s safe to upgrade the old version and one

sli pmwiki troubleshooting classes group research publications code login pmwiki troubleshooting frequently answered questions documentation index available actions administrators pmwiki is pretty robust and can automatically adapt to a very wide variety of environments however sometimes things don t go as we expect so we re cataloging common errors and their fixes here troubleshooting frequently asked questions note this page on pmwiki org is probably not the best place to post questions consider seeking assistance from the pmwiki users mailing list or post your question on the pmwiki questions page my wiki displays warnings deprecated preg replace the e modifier is deprecated use preg replace callback instead this is caused by a change in php version 5 5 for the preg replace function pmwiki no longer relies on the deprecated feature since version 2 2 56 it is recommended to upgrade to the latest version but many recipes do note that even if the warning points to a line in pmwiki php the problem comes from a local configuration or recipe recipes and skins are currently being updated for php 5 5 check if there are more recent versions published by their maintainers on the cookbook if you update your pmwiki and recipes and still see the warnings here is how to find out which recipes cause them for pmwiki version 2 2 71 or newer in config php enable diagnostic tools enablediag 1 then visit your wiki with the action ruleset for example http www pmwiki org wiki pmwiki pmwiki action ruleset or follow a link like homepage action ruleset this page will list all markup rules those potentially incompatible with php 5 5 will be flagged with filenames line numbers and search patterns triggering the warning if the action ruleset page shows no flagged rules it is possible that either your recipes call the preg replace function directly or they define various search replace patterns in incompatible ways in these cases your warning should display the file name and line number causing problems if not here is how to track it in config php disable all recipes included files from the cookbook directory or a custom skin or any line containing patterns you can insert at the beginning of a line to disable it then test the wiki if you have disabled everything the warning message should disappear next re enable your customizations one after another every time testing the wiki if at some point the warnings re appear you ll know that the customization you just enabled is not compatible with php 5 5 you can contact the authors of the broken recipes and kindly ask them to update their recipes for php 5 5 recent pmwiki versions add new helper functions which make it easy see custommarkup if you cannot have the recipes fixed by their authors tell us and we ll try to fix them note that many hosting providers allow you to run different versions of php see the documentation of your hosting plan to learn how to enable a php version earlier than 5 5 finally it is possible to suppress these warnings in php 5 5 by setting this line at the beginning of config php error reporting e all e notice e deprecated this should be a temporary solution left only until your recipes are fixed after a php upgrade some of the pages on my wiki are completely blank empty some have blank or missing sections but the sidebar and the action links are visible this can be caused by a change in php 5 4 which affects the function htmlspecialchars the easiest temporary fix would be in your php ini or in user ini to change the default charset directive to an 8 bit charset for example cp1252 default charset windows 1252 or this may sometimes work in pmwiki local config php ini set default charset windows 1252 a more permanent fix would be to upgrade your installation to a more recent pmwiki version your recipes and in your own recipes or modules replace all calls to htmlspecialchars with phsc a pmwiki helper function for such cases the blank pages come from the fact that in php 5 4 the default encoding switched from an 8 bit encoding to variable bit validated utf 8 and that an incorrect utf 8 string will be rejected if your wiki uses an 8 bit encoding it is virtually certain that it is not valid utf 8 worse even if you do use utf 8 some browsers may submit invalid bits so the phsc function always pretends that it converts an 8 bit encoding where all bits are allowed why am i seeing strange errors after upgrading make sure all of the files were updated in particular pmwiki php this question sometimes arises when an administrator hasn t followed the advice which used to be less prominent on the installation and initial setup tasks pages and has renamed pmwiki php instead of creating an index php wrapper script if you have renamed pmwiki php to index php then the upgrade procedure won t have updated your index php file delete the old version and create a wrapper script so it won t happen again sometimes an ftp or other copy program will fail to transfer all of the files properly one way to check for this is by comparing file sizes be sure all of the files in the wikilib d directory were also upgraded sometimes it s a good idea to simply delete the wikilib d directory before upgrading local copies of pages are stored in wiki d and not wikilib d make sure that the file permissions are correct the official files have a restricted set of permissions that might not match your site s needs if you use a custom pattern for grouppattern make sure that it includes site sitegroup and since pmwiki 2 2 also siteadmin siteadmingroup otherwise migration may fail e g missing siteadmin for pmwiki 2 2 and later and or login does not work additionally main defaultgroup should be included too i m suddenly getting messages like warning fopen wiki d flock failed to open stream permission denied and cannot acquire lockfile what s wrong something or someone has changed the permissions on the wiki d flock file or the wiki d directory such that the webserver is no longer able to write the lockfile the normal solution is to simply delete the flock file from the wiki d directory pmwiki will then create a new one also be sure to check the permissions on the wiki d directory itself one can easily check and modify permissions of the wiki d directory in filezilla open source ftp app by right clicking on the file file attributes my links in the sidebar seem to be pointing to non existent pages even though i know i created the pages where are the pages links in the sidebar normally need to be qualified by a wikigroup in order to work properly use group page instead of page also make sure you type sidebar with a capital b why am i seeing php warning cannot modify header information headers already sent by messages at the top of my page if this is the first or only error message you re seeing it s usually an indication that there are blank lines spaces or other characters before the php or after the in a local customization files such as config php double check the file and make sure there is nothing before the initial php it s often easiest and safest to eliminate any closing altogether on windows it may be but shouldn t be necessary to use a hex editor to convert lfcr line endings to lf line endings in the local config php file when you save the file the encoding charset should be either cp1252 windows1252 or utf 8 without byte order mark notepad is an editor that can do this when you transfer the files tell your ftp manager to use text mode transfer or if that doesn t help binary mode transfer if the warning is appearing after some other warning or error message then resolve the other error and this warning may go away how do i make a php warning about function session write close go away if you are seeing an error similar to this warning session write close function session write close open some filesystem path to a directory sess failed no such file or directory 2 in your filesystem path to pmwiki php on line nnn pmwiki sometimes does session tracking using php s session handling functions for session tracking to work some information needs to be written in a directory on the server that directory needs to exist and be writable by the webserver software for this example the webserver software is configured to write sessions in this directory some filesystem path to a directory but the directory doesn t exist the solution is to do at least one of these create the directory and make sure it s writable by the webserver software provide a session save path value that points to a directory that is writable by the server e g in config php session save path home someuser tmp sessions unix type os session save path c server tmp sessions windows why is pmwiki prompting me multiple times for a password i ve already entered this could happen like out of nowhere if your hosting provider upgrades to php version 5 3 and you run an older pmwiki release recent pmwiki releases fix this problem alternatively this may be an indication that the browser isn t accepting cookies or that php s session handling functions on the server aren t properly configured if the browser is accepting cookies then try setting enablediag 1 in local config php run pmwiki using action phpinfo and verify that sessions are enabled and that the session save path has a reasonable value note that several versions of php under windows require that a session save path be explicitly set this can be done in the local config php file you might also try setting session auto start to 1 in your php ini see also the question i have to log in twice below i edited config php but when i look at my wiki pages all i see is parse error parse error unexpected t variable in somefile on line number you ve made a mistake in writing the php that goes into the config php file the most common mistake that causes the t variable error is forgetting the semi colon at the end of a line that you added the line number and file named are where you should look for the mistake searches and pagelists stopped working after i upgraded no errors are reported but links to other pages do not appear or do not appear as they should what gives be sure all of the files in the wikilib d directory were also upgraded in particular it sounds as if the site pagelisttemplates page is either missing if no links are displayed or is an old version if the links do not appear as they should also make sure that read permissions attr are set for the pages site pagelisttemplates and site search some of my posts are coming back with 403 forbidden or 406 not acceptable errors or internal server error this happens with some posts but not others your webserver probably has mod security enabled the mod security feature scans all incoming posts for forbidden words or phrases that might indicate someone is trying to hack the system and if any of them are present then apache returns the 403 forbidden or 406 not acceptable error common phrases that tend to trigger mod security include curl wget file and system although there are many others depending on the configuration percent signs html tags international characters since mod security intercepts the requests and sends the forbidden message before pmwiki ever gets a chance to run it s not a bug in pmwiki and there s little that pmwiki can do about it instead one has to alter the webserver configuration to disable mod security or reconfigure it to allow whatever word it is forbidding some sites may be able to disable mod security by placing secfilterengine off in a htaccess file i get the following message when attempting to upload an image what do i do warning move uploaded file safe mode restriction in effect the

see division by zero error in pmwiki php on my site what s wrong it s a bug in pmwiki that occurs only with the tables markup and only for versions of php 4 4 6 or 5 2 0 often it seems to occur out of nowhere because the server administrator has upgraded php try upgrading to a later version of pmwiki to remove the error or try setting the following in local config php tablerowindexmax 1 i have to log in twice two times 2 times or my password is not being required even though it should or i changed the password but the old password is still active or my config php password is not over riding my farmconfig php password it could happen if farm config php or an included recipe directly calls the functions condauth or retrieveauthpage pagetextvar pagevar and possibly others before defining all passwords and before including authuser if required the order of config php is very significant when editing an existing page the save causes a no response of your server not a blank page no response at all an endless connexion try to get back the hand it is necessary to request for another page by clicking on its link in the menu for instance and horror the action edit is then inhibited it becomes impossible to edit any page when the editing of a page is initiated a file names flock is created in the wiki d repertory as long as this file exists it is impossible to edit any page this file denotes an edition in progress and is automatically destroyed when leaving successfully an edit action by save in case of a crash of the editing this file is not destroyed the remedy is with an ftp client parameterized to show hidden files to remove the flock file and all get back ok this behavior is typically caused by a bug which provokes directly or indirectly an endless loop in a recipe

numbered headers for numbered headings escape sequence anything placed between and is not interpreted by pmwiki but paragraphs are reformatted this makes it possible to turn off special formatting interpretations and neutralise wikiwords that are not links even easier is to use a tick in front like wikiword for preformatted text blocks use the markup it does neither reformat paragraphs nor

sli pmwiki tables classes group research publications code login pmwiki tables uploads documentation index table directives authors basic table basics pmwiki has two types of table markup the markup described in this page is useful for creating simple tables with lots of small cells while table directive markups help with larger scale tables for more possibilities with table formatting see cookbook rowspan in simple tables and cookbook formatting tables tables are created via use of double pipe characters lines beginning with this markup denote rows in a table or a formatting line within table row lines the double pipe is used to delimit cells in the examples below a border is added for illustration the default is no border the first line in the markup contains formatting commands for the table it only has double pipe characters at the start of the line basic table border 1 cell 1 cell 2 cell 3 cell 1 cell 2 cell 1cell 2cell 3 cell 1cell 2 header cells can be created

sli pmwiki table directives classes group research publications code login pmwiki table directives tables documentation index wiki styles authors intermediate there are six directives for table processing all must be at the beginning of a line to have any effect table attr generates a new html table tag with the attributes provided in attr closes the previous table if any valid attributes and values are border a positive integer bordercolor a color name or hex number doesn t display in all browsers cellspacing a positive integer indicating the space between cells cellpadding a positive integer indicating the interior border of a cell width a positive integer or percent bgcolor a color name or hex number align left center or right summary does not display used primarily to help visually disabled people navigate cellnr attr cell attr headnr attr head attr the head directive opens a new header cell of the table creates th tag in html the cell directive opens a new regular cell of the table creates td tag in html the directives headnr and cellnr open a new cell on a new row in the table these directives close any previous cell and or row note the head and headnr directives exist from pmwiki version 2 2 11 or newer valid attributes and values are align left center or right valign top middle or bottom default is top see note below colspan a positive integer rowspan a positive integer bgcolor a color name or hex number width a positive integer or percent class a css class of the cell style custom css styles of the cell tableend closes the previous table cell and closes off any table generates th td tr and table tags as needed valign attribute if not already set pmwiki will automatically include the attribute valign top with all cell nr and head nr pm said table directives were created for layout purposes and in that case it makes the most sense for each cell column to have its content at the top of the row the attribute is placed in each cell and not in the row because certain browsers didn t recognize valign top in the row tag see enabletableautovaligntop on how to disable the automatic insertion of the attribute notes for the table cell and cellnr tags the author can specify any attributes that would be valid in the html table or td tags thus you can specify rowspan colspan etc arguments to build arbitrary tables however it s not possible to nest a table inside of a cell or cellnr the next paragraph explains why many are likely to ask why we didn t just use the standard html table markup table tr td th instead of creating a new markup and allowing nested tables as a result there are two answers first the html table markup is very ugly for naive authors see pmwiki audiences and pmwikiphilosophy 2 and second it d be very easy for authors to create tables that are incorrect html and that display incorrectly or not at all on some browsers even seasoned web professionals sometimes get the table markup wrong so it s a bit unrealistic to expect the average author to always get it right or to be able to read arbitrary html table markup that someone else has created common comment surely the average or naive author would not be writing html directly but using a tool such as frontpage or even msword to generate the html this would be a lot simpler than learning even the simplest pmwiki markups pm s response and once the html has been generated and posted how is someone else going to edit or modify the table if they don t have the original frontpage or msword file used to create it remember that we re talking about collaborative authoring the html that those packages generate is among the hardest to read and edit of all it s difficult to write the code needed to make pmwiki understand and fix arbitrary table markup so pmwiki uses the simplified version above still this version is able to handle most table requirements with the possible exception of nested tables and this is not to say that nested html tables are impossible in pmwiki they just can t be easily created by wiki authors using the default wiki markup a site administrator can of course create header footer html code and other local customizations that make use of nested tables example 1 a table using table directive markup nbsp is a non breaking space in html place it in a cell if a cell is to be empty or the border of the cell will not be drawn properly table border 1 cellpadding 5 cellspacing 0 head a1 cell b1 cell c1 cell d1 headnr a2 cell b2 cell c2 cell nbsp tableend a1 b1 c1 d1 a2 b2 c2 in html this is the same as table border 1 cellpadding 5 cellspacing 0 tr th a1 th td b1 td td c1 td td d1 td tr tr th a2 th td b2 td td c2 td td nbsp td tr table floating table with bulleted navigation list what if you wanted to create a nice little table like a table of contents in a page like this in this example the table is floating right and contains some links in a bulleted list this is a nice demonstration of how it s possible to build a little table of contents in the page which might navigate to other pages just within the same wiki group note that having a bulleted list won t work in a ordinary table it only works inside an table created with table directives such as the example code used here table border 1 width 30 align right bgcolor cccc99 cellspacing 0 cellnr navigation links cellnr tables table directives tableend navigation links tables table directives table border 1 width 30 align right bgcolor cccc99 cellspacing 0 cellnr colspan 2 align center navigation links cellnr align center tables cell align center table directives tableend navigation links tables table directives looking at the markup here notice that we have used a cccc99 hex color for the table background also the cellnr markup creates a new row a new cell and closes the row at the end you could take this concept a little further since you might want each page in the group to contain the same table of contents you can make one table like the above and put it in its own page then use an include on any of your pages and bring in the table the float align property will be honored in each page where it s included can i

sli pmwiki skintemplates classes group research publications code login pmwiki skintemplates skins documentation index site preferences this page describes the skin template files tmpl that are used to create pmwiki skins and how pmwiki uses them as described in the skins page a skin is a collection of files that specifies the layout for pmwiki pages each skin must include a template file that provides the skeleton for displaying a pmwiki page finding and processing templates when you set the value of the skin variable in a configuration file like local config php like this use the foo skin skin foo it tells pmwiki to search for a skin of that name and use it the usual result of the search is for pmwiki to load a template file from the appropriate skin directory in this example that would probably be the file pub skins foo foo tmpl the actual processing that pmwiki goes through to find a template file is important for those who are making complex skins so its worth mentioning what those steps are security note the default value for skinlibdirs has server side and client side files stored in the same publicly accessible directory that is skindir and skindirurl point to the same place this is done for convenience both for the skin user and the skin writer but it is not necessary it has the side effect that its possible to construct a url like this one that will let you look at the contents of the the tmpl or php files that a skin uses this is usually not an issue as skin files should not contain any sensitive information still a purist might want to move their tmpl and php files out of the directories that are accessible as urls and modify their skinlibdirs array to reflect this when pagetemplatefmt is blank as it should be pmwiki gathers the names of all candidate skins it starts with any action specific skin that is specified in actionskin action thus if the current action is login and actionskin login is bar then pmwiki will look for a skin named bar if no skin has been found yet it looks for the skin s named in the skin variable which is allowed to be an array and uses the first skin it can find if it gets to the end of the list without finding a skin it issues an error to attempt to find a skin pmwiki first consults the skinlibdirs variable to know where to look skins consist of server side files that are loaded by pmwiki such as php and tmpl files and client side files such as css files and images that will be requested by the user s browser when they look at a skinned pmwiki page skinlibdirs is an array of key value pairs the key is a directory to look in for the server side files while the corresponding value is a url that points to the public client side resources used by the skin the default value of skinlibdirs is skinlibdirs array pub skins skin pubdirurl skins skin farmd pub skins skin farmpubdirurl skins skin so using the above definitions pmwiki would try to find the skin foo by looking for a directory called pub skins foo and then for farmd pub skins foo with the value of farmd replaced by the root server directory for farm files the first such directory that was found would be assumed to contain the skin it was looking for it would then set skindir to the name of this directory and skindirurl to the corresponding url once a valid skin directory has been found pmwiki starts processing the files in that directory looking for a php skin file to run it first looks for one with the same name as the skin so if the skin is foo it looks for foo php if no such file is found it then checks for a file named skin php if one of these php files is found pmwiki loads and runs it this allows a skin to define custom markup or custom configuration parameters it also allows a skin to choose between which of several different tmpl files to load to specify which tmpl file to load simply call loadpagetemplate inside the skin php file with the name of the tmpl file to be loaded loadpagetemplate pagename skindir xyz tmpl for example a skin might specify a special template to be used if the action is print if globals action print loadpagetemplate pagename skindir print tmpl when the action is something else pmwiki will fall back to loading the default tmpl file instead if no appropriate php file is found or if that file doesn t load a template then pmwiki falls back to looking for a template with the same name as the skin or failing that any tmpl file at all so long as its the only one in the directory if it finds one it will load and process it if not it will issue an error template file format a template file is basically an html file that also contains variable substitutions indicated by and special directives embedded in html comments the following special directives are required in the template file the directive pagetext belongs to the body section of the html document and tells pmwiki where the main content of each wiki page should be placed the directive htmlheader which goes somewhere in the head section of the html document the directive htmlfooter directive which typically goes before the final body tag and is used by some recipes to insert things at the end of the html document prior to pmwiki 2 2 0 the htmlfooter directive was optional when pmwiki displays a page it replaces the directives and variable substitutions with the values appropriate to the current page for example the pagetext directive is replaced with the page s contents while any instances of pageurl are replaced with the url address of the current page note your skin template shouldn t have a meta tag specifying the charset encoding as pmwiki adds this tag when needed there is a long list of variables available for substitution in pages some of the most useful include pageurl the url of the current page scripturl the base url to the pmwiki php script title the page s title e g skintemplates titlespaced the page s title with spaces e g skin templates group the name of the current group e g pmwiki fullname the page s full name e g pmwiki skintemplates lastmodified the page s last modification time pagelogourl the url of a site logo wikititle the site s title skindirurl the url of the skin s folder this last variable skindirurl is particularly useful in templates as it allows the skin designer to refer to other files such as images or style sheets in the skin folder without having to know the exact url the template is not limited to using the variables listed here nearly any php global variable that begins with a capital letter can be used in a skin template page variables can also be used in templates skin directives besides the required pagetext and htmlheader directives pmwiki provides other built in directives for generating page output it s not necessary to use any of these directives but they can often add capabilities to a skin wiki main somepage page main somepage the wiki main somepage directive outputs the contents of main somepage substitutions are allowed in directives thus a directive like wiki group somepage will include somepage of the current group if multiple pages are listed in the directive then only the first available page is used thus wiki group somepage site somepage will display the contents of somepage in the current group if it exists and site somepage if it doesn t to always display site somepage even if group somepage exists use two consecutive wiki directives the wiki directive only displays pages for which the browser has read permissions the page directive displays pages even if the browser doesn t have read permission file somefile txt the directive file somefile txt outputs the contents of another file on the local filesystem at the point of the directive if the file to be included is a php script then the php script is executed and its output is sent to the browser like the wiki directive above substitutions are available to be able to output files based on the current page name or group markup the markup directive processes any text that follows the colon as wiki markup and displays that in the output function somefunction args this directive calls a php function named somefunction passing the current page s name as first argument and the optional text following the function name as second argument php functions called in this manner are typically defined in a local customization file args allows only one argument which has to be split in your function function somefunction arg1 arg2 arg3 will call somefunction pagename arg1 arg2 arg3 when the skin is processed however variables can be used like lastmodifiedby page sections a template file can designate sections that are included or excluded from the output based on page directives or other criteria a section always begins with page fmt and continues to the next section the end of the template file or page fmt for example a template can specify a pageleftfmt section that is excluded from the output whenever the noleft directive is encountered in the page s contents pmwiki s predefined sections and their corresponding page directives are pageheaderfmt noheader pagefooterfmt nofooter pagetitlefmt notitle pageleftfmt noleft pagerightfmt noright pageactionfmt noaction skin designers can define custom sections and markups but currently all section names in the template must begin with page and end with fmt as mentioned you also have to define the corresponding markup for example in your config php like this markup noxyz directives noxyz ei settmpldisplay pagexyzfmt 0 and better compatible with php version 5 5 for pmwiki 2 2 58 markup e noxyz directives noxyz i settmpldisplay pagexyzfmt 0 see also the recipe skins testpagedirectives can help you test your skins with combinations of the above directives internationalization i18n skins can also be internationalized by using substitutions any string placed inside of is treated as a translatable phrase and the phrase is looked up in the current translation tables for a corresponding output phrase if a translation is available then the translated phrase is substituted at that point otherwise the original phrase is left intact for example the substitution edit will display the current translation of edit if it is known otherwise it displays edit thus the same template can be used for multiple languages displaying editer when french translations are loaded bearbeiten when german translations are loaded and edit when no translation is available how do i customize the css styling of my pmwiki layout see skins for how to change the default pmwiki skin see also skins where you will find pre made templates you can use to customize the appearance of your site you can also create a file called local css in the pub css directory and add css selectors there this file gets automatically loaded if it exists or styles can be added directly into a local customization file by using something like

sli pmwiki skins classes group research publications code login pmwiki skins group customizations documentation index skin templates administrators basic contents what is a skin where do i get skins how do i use a skin how can i modify an existing skin how can i make a skin what s a skin a skin changes the look and feel of a pmwiki page group of pages or the entire wiki to see this try some skins out using the links below beeblebroxnetgila jhskin amber adapt monobook simple pmwiki default as you see all skins show the same page contents but the other elements such as the sidebar header and footer have changed for example different skins may display the sidebar on the left on the right or even not at all some skins have action links and features that others do not especially if they were designed to take advantage of particular cookbook recipes so a skin is just the set of files that determine how pages are displayed in pmwiki skins are stored as subfolders of pub skins for example you might create the example skin in pub skins example each skin typically has one or more of the following kinds of files a template file such as skin tmpl or example tmpl the template is written in html or xhtml and is the skeleton for the skin it contains special markers that tell pmwiki where to insert the page s contents css stylesheet files which can control the skin s appearance such as pmwiki css or example css image files for decorating a page with images php files such as skin php or example php these let skins provide extra customization setting or capabilities that html and css alone cannot documentation files for the administrator usually with names like readme txt install txt or skinname txt these usually give you information about any special installation steps or nifty features the skin has where do i get skins skins are available in the skins collection the skins in the collection have been contributed by many pmwiki administrators for all to use and typically have their own set of customization possibilities when you find a skin you like follow the link to download the skin package you can also make your own skin how do i use or install a skin most skin packages are zip tgz or tar gz files you should be able to unpack these with most archiving software unpack the skin to pub skins inside your pmwiki folder most well designed skin packages will create a subfolder in pub skins named after the skin if the skin did not make a folder of its own create one and move the skin files to it open up your local config php file and add a line like skin example where example is the name of the skin s folder reload a page from your wiki in the browser and you should be able to see the difference if you d like to let your site s visitors choose one skin from a selection of skins you ve installed look at the skin change recipe that s what we used for the demo above how can i modify an existing skin there are a number of ways to further customize the appearance of a skin including adding statements to local config php that are compatible with your chosen skin adding css files to pub css such as local css for your entire wiki and mygroup css for mygroup and directly editing the skin s files if the skin is updated regularly you probably will want to avoid editing the files in the skin s folder check the skin s page in the cookbook for specific suggestions if you want to modify the default pmwiki or print skins included with the pmwiki distribution you should copy the pub skins pmwiki and pub skins print directories to another name and then use those skins instead of the default ones while the name of the skin tmpl and skin css files don t usually matter the optional skin php file must match the name of the skin how can i make a skin the best way to make your first skin is to modify a copy of pmwiki s default skin make a copy of the folder pub skins pmwiki and name it whatever your new skin should be named in your local config php file set skin to be the name of your new skin modify the template and css files to suit you test your new skin repeat steps 3 and 4 until you re happy with the results the reason we recommend starting with the default pmwiki skin is that it s quite a simple skin much more so than many of the skins you ll find in skins the starting point is the template tmpl file which provides the overall layout of the page inside of the template file are a number of special substitutions and directives that provide places for pmwiki to insert the data relevant to the current page being displayed skin templates describes the format and directives in more detail there are also skin guidelines available on pmwiki org it s beyond the scope of this page to explain how to write html hypertext markup language xhtml extensible html which is a bit newer or css cascading style sheets but there are many good tutorials on the web for all three of them one caution if you run into an html tutorial that explains about how to use font or blink tags or spacer gifs it s at least five years out of date so skip it and find another one you should test your skin on a variety of browsers ideally as many as you can on as many different platforms as you can but at minimum you should be testing on internet explorer 8 firefox 3 and chrome since those are the most common and have different bugs it is also useful to test on opera and safari don t forget to do things like resize windows and change text size during your testing print skins by default your new skin will use the standard pub skins print skin to over ride this add the following to local config php actionskin print yourprintskin this says to use yourprintskin for action print instead of the default tools that you ll need there are good examples of all these programs available for free html and css editor s there are two types of editors graphical wysiwyg or what you see is what you get and hand coding or programmer s editors graphical editors are less intimidating to novices but you won t learn as much or know your code as intimately as you will by using a hand coding editor whichever you choose get one that has syntax highlighting for the code because it will help you spot mistakes also live preview features are not that helpful when writing a pmwiki skin because pmwiki does stuff that the live preview won t such as substitute values for variables and insert sidebar content test wiki you don t want to be wreaking havoc on your skin while visitors can see your site it s a better idea to set up a test wiki either on your real webserver or on your own machine linux or macos computer owners may have webservers and php already running on their machines but windows users often don t if that describes you then you might want to take a look at the cookbook standalone recipe which runs pmwiki without needing a complex webserver or cookbook installoniis or you can find many local server packages which install a webserver php and other stuff e g mysql all configured to work together try to get a package that has the same software and versions as used on your live setup since then there will be less to go wrong when the site goes live ftp client to transfer files to your webserver you probably had one of these already color picker your editor might include one or you could pick up a standalone application extremely

handle on how most of the other lines work list each line is an item in an unordered list marked up by an unindented you can find out more about lists on the basic editing page pmwiki will normally display an unordered list as a set of bulleted items but they can appear differently depending on the context and styles they are displayed in this difference in display is generally controlled by css defined in the skin for the pageactions links the list items are displayed inline style following the on the line we have item which is a wikistyle it is used to control the properties of a given output element like its size or color by default they apply to the text between them and the end of the line or a closing whichever is sooner so for example one can enter this blue text is blue and it will appear as this text is blue in this case the wikistyle starts with the word item and that says to apply the given style to the entire list item as opposed to just the text that follows in particular it causes pmwiki to generate html of li class edit li instead of li span class edit span li setting the class attribute of the list item allows css properties to be applied to the item that corresponds to the current action for example to have the current action display with a background color of blue a wiki administrator can do htmlstylesfmt action background color blue then if the current action is edit as in action edit the list item corresponding to the edit action will be drawn with a blue background the other property inside the item wikistyle is the accesskey statement accesskeys are keyboard shortcuts for tasks that would otherwise require a mouse they can be attached to links or to form elements and the wikistyle will use whichever it finds first on the line in this case they will attach to the link fullname view accesskey an accesskey can be defined in a number of locations but essentially it is a phrase translation following the model used for internationalizations pmwiki s accesskey defaults are defined in scripts prefs php but can be overridden in lots of different places including skins language translation pages xlpage and even per browser preferences see site preferences the markup defines phrase translations used for internationalizations and access keys as noted above in the first line of site pageactions it is used in both ak view and view essentially view tells pmwiki to substitute the current translation of view if no translation is defined for view then pmwiki just uses the phrase inside the brackets you can most easily see this working in the other languages sections of pmwiki for example at pmwikide pmwikide you ll notice that the default view edit history and print actions are displayed as artikel bearbeiten historie and druckansicht this is because the pmwikide group is loading in a set of translations from pmwikide xlpage that page defines things like view artikel edit bearbeiten history historie print druckansicht which says that things like view and edit should be replaced by artikel and bearbeiten this makes it very easy for pmwiki to support multiple languages since a recipe author can simply put any translatable prompts or phrases inside of and leave it to others to actually build the translation tables either locally or on pmwiki org for others to use more information about is available at internationalizations link all that leaves on the first line to be explained is the link itself fullname view links are not complex but this one is using both the internationalization feature and a page variable the view has already been explained and it shows up in the link text section of link markup so that if viewed in english the link will appear as view the link target section contains the fullname variable this variable expands to the full name of the page on which it is being displayed including the group and page names for simple browsing this is good enough because viewing a page is the default action to perform on a page later lines use link targets like fullname action edit which says to go to the currently displayed page and start editing it if this explains what all of the lines are about that only leaves the if auth upload and ifend lines and they go together the first starts some conditional markup and the second ends it the if test markup only lets the following text be displayed if the test succeeds the text that conditionally displayed ends at the next if statement so an empty ifend is a convenient way to end the conditional block the particular test being used here is auth upload which is only true if the current user is authorized to upload files to the wiki thus the conditional block says to only display a link to perform an upload if the user is actually allowed to upload depending on the security and permissions model on a given site its not unusual to see many more conditional markups that test if for example a user has editing rights to the current page more information on all the different conditions can be found at the conditional markup page and a general index of all the pmwiki documentation can be found at documentation index hopefully this bit of documentation has answered your questions about the site pageactions page if not you may wish to consult the helpful people on one of the pmwiki mailing lists group pageactions note that any group can have a pageactions page not just site if a page named group pageactions exists it will be used otherwise site pageactions much like for

september 2006 in a nutshell he differentiates two cases the possible vulnerability isn t already known publicly in this case please contact us by private mail the possible vulnerability is already known publicly in this case feel free to discuss the vulnerability in public e g on pmwiki users or in the pits see his post mentioned above for details and rationals what about the botnet security advisory at http isc sans org diary php storyid 1672 sites that are running with php s register globals setting set to on and versions of pmwiki prior to 2 1 21 may be vulnerable to a botnet exploit that is taking advantage of a bug in php the vulnerability can be closed by turning register globals off upgrading to pmwiki 2 1 21 or later or upgrading to php versions 4 4 3 or 5 1 4 in addition there is a test at pmwiki siteanalyzer that can be used to determine if your site is vulnerable wiki vandalism and spam assumptions you are using a blocklist and url approvals you don t want to resort to password protecting the entire wiki that s not the point after all ideally these protections will be invoked in config php how do i stop pages being deleted eg password protect a page from deletion use cookbook deleteaction and password protect the page deletion action by adding defaultpasswords delete to config php or password protect the action with handleauth delete edit or handleauth delete admin to require the edit or admin password respectively how do i stop pages being replaced with an empty all spaces page add block s to your blocklist how do i stop pages being completely replaced by an inane comment such as excellent site great information where the content cannot be blocked try using the newer automatic blocklists that pull information and ip addresses about known wiki defacers or try using cookbook captchas or cookbook captcha note these are different or set an edit password but make it publicly available on the site authform template how do i password protect the creation of new groups see cookbook limit wiki groups how do i password protect the creation of new pages see cookbook limit new pages in wiki groups how do i take a whitelist approach where users from known

filesystem can read them for example a technician of your hosting provider your ip address may change from time to time unless you have a fixed ip contract with your isp when that happens someone with your old ip address will be logged in automatically as admin on your wiki it is extremely unlikely to become a problem but you should know it is possible if you are behind a router all other devices which pass through that router will have the same ip address for pmwiki your wifi phone your wife s netbook a neighbour using your wifi connection etc all these people become admins of your wiki again you should evaluate if this is a security risk in some cases your isp will route your traffic through the same proxy as other people in such a case thousands of people may have the same ip address see

like a wikisandbox you should also disable pagelists add to config php this line enablepagelist 0 this version has an important change for international wikis the xlpage function no longer loads encoding scripts such as xlpage utf 8 php when you upgrade you need to include those scripts from config php before calling xlpage include once scripts xlpage utf 8 php if your wiki uses utf 8 xlpage bg pmwikibg xlpage all links can now have tooltip titles previously only images and external links could have tooltip titles now this feature is enabled for internal links to set a tooltip title add it in quotes after the link address main homepage this is a tooltip title main homepage this is a tooltip title home http www pmwiki org home of pmwiki attach image jpg tooltip title of the image the following new upload extensions were added svg xcf ogg flac ogv mp4 webm odg epub a couple of minor optimizations were added markupexpressions and rendering of page history and the documentation was updated version 2 2 34 2011 10 10 this version resets the timestamps of the default pages site admin authuser which are expected in case of upgrades from the versions 2 1 core markupexpressions which manipulate strings should now work better with international characters the documentation was updated to its latest state from pmwiki org version 2 2 33 2011 09 23 this version fixes a security bug introduced in 2 2 32 which left the groups site and siteadmin open for reading and editing because the pages site groupattributes and siteadmin groupattributes didn t have all necessary attributes all wikis running 2 2 32 should upgrade if you cannot immediately upgrade you can set the attributes from your wiki open the attributes page siteadmin groupattributes action attr and set a read and an edit password lock is recommended open the attributes page site groupattributes action attr and set an edit password lock is recommended do not set a read password here the release also fixes the refcount php script to produce valid html and updates intermap txt entries pits and wikipedia to point to their current locations version 2 2 32 2011 09 18 this is the first version shipping with the core documentation in the utf 8 encoding pmwiki will automatically convert it on the fly for wikis using an older encoding it is recommended that all new pmwiki installations enable utf 8 migration of existing wikis from an older encoding to utf 8 shouldn t be rushed it is not trivial and will be documented in the future a required html xmlns attribute was added to the print skin template the history rendering is now faster when many lines are added or removed note due to a manipulation error a version 2 2 31 was created before it was ready for a release version 2 2 30 2011 08 13 this version fixes a charset definition in international iso 8859 php files this will help for a future transition to utf 8 a variable enablerangematchutf8 was added set it to 1 to enable range matches of pagenames in utf 8 like a d previously the range matches were always enabled in utf 8 but we found out that on some installations this feature breaks all pagelists even those without range matches in case the feature worked for you you can re enable it version 2 2 29 2011 07 24 this release fixes attach links that were broken with the path fix in 2 2 28 earlier today version 2 2 28 2011 07 24 this release fixes 2 potential xss vulnerabilities and a bug with path links version 2 2 27 2011 06 19 this release fixes a validation bug on pages after a redirection a new block wikistyle justify was added allowing left and right aligned text the page history now accepts a url parameter nodiff 1 which hides the rendering of edit differences showing only timestamps authors summaries and restore links it allows to restore a vandalized page with a huge contents or history which otherwise would break the memory or time limits of the server version 2 2 26 2011 05 21 this release fixes a redundant removal of link hashes from wikitrails and updates the documentation to the most recent version from pmwiki org version 2 2 25 2011 03 22 this release only updates the documentation to the latest state on pmwiki org version 2 2 24 2011 02 15 this version reverts the way existing pagevariables are processed like version 2 2 21 or earlier but it adds a special variable authpage which can be used in pagevar definitions it is the same as the page array but exists only if the visitor has read permissions for example an administrator can set to config php fmtpv lastmodifiedsummary authpage csum instead of page csum then the edit summary metadata will only be available if the user has read permissions version 2 2 23 2011 01 25 this version sets the default value of enablepagevarauth to 0 until we investigate a reported problem with authentication version 2 2 22 2011 01 16 this version adds the variable enablexlpagescriptload which if set to 0 will prevent authors to load scripts from xlpage and to accidentally change the encoding of the wiki if you use it make sure you include the required files eg xlpage utf 8 php from local config files pagevariables should now respect authentications without read permissions the title description change summary author of a protected page are unavailable pagevariables that are computed without reading the page are still available eg group namespaced version etc administrators can revert the previous behavior by adding to config php such a line enablepagevarauth 0 version 2 2 21 2010 12 14 due to a mis configuration of a local svn repository some of the changes intended for 2 2 20 didn t make it in the correct branch this release corrects this version 2 2 20 2010 12 14 this version fixes a potential xss vulnerability reported today an authuser bug with excluding users from authgroups was fixed a new intermap prefix pml10n was added it leads to the localization section on pmwiki org and should help the work of translators a couple of other minor bugs were fixed and the documentation was updated version 2 2 19 2010 11 10 this is a documentation update release version 2 2 18 2010 09 04 this version fixes 3 minor bugs and updates the documentation version 2 2 17 2010 06 20 this version adds a variable postconfig containing functions and scripts to be loaded after stdconfig php tabindex was added as a valid form field attribute protected downloads now respect existing browser caches authuser now allows more flexible cookbook recipe integration a couple of bugs were fixed and the documentation was updated version 2 2 16 2010 05 10 this version fixes a bug with parsing html attributes which could allow xss injection wikis allowing unprotected editing are encouraged to upgrade a bug with the center button of the gui edit toolbar was corrected the exists conditional now accepts wildcards for example if exists main there are pages in the main group if the documentation was updated version 2 2 15 2010 03 27 this version adds some minor bugfixes and optimizations notably a bug with template none introduced in the last version 2 2 14 version 2 2 14 2010 02 27 this release corrects inline styles for wikitrail links undefined include template variables are now removed from the included section like page text variables and can be used in conditional expressions if needed this change can be reverted by adding to config php such a line enableundefinedtemplatevars 1 keep and display unset variables pagelist templates now accept the sections first and last for markup to appear for every page in list except the first or last one title attributes were added to external links you can have tooltip titles on external links including intermap and attachments by adding the link title in double quotes after the url http www pmwiki org home of pmwiki external link for international wikis pmwiki now automatically translates the titles of technical pages like groupattributes or recentchanges just define these strings as usual in xlpage for example in french allrecentchanges tous les changements r cents some minor optimizations were done and the documentation was updated version 2 2 13 2010 02 21 this release fixes a bug with diffkeepnum introduced in 2 2 10 the count of revisions was incorrect and a page could drop more revisions than it should the page history layout was modified with a rough consensus in the community the history now defaults to source view with word level highlighting of the differences authors can see the changes in rendered output by clicking on the link show changes to output admins can switch back the default by adding such a line to config php diffshow source request source y y n to disable word level highlighting and show plain text changes enablediffinline 0 in the page history rendering a few minor bugs were fixed and the code was slightly optimized the documentation was updated version 2 2 12 2010 02 17 this release adds simple word level highlighting of differences in the page history when show changes to markup is selected to enable the feature add to config php such a line enablediffinline 1 this feature is like what the inlinediff recipe provides but not exactly the same and the implementation is simpler it is enabled on pmwiki org and can be improved your comments are welcome version 2 2 11 2010 02 14 this release adds two new table directives for header cells head and headnr they work the same way as cell and cellnr except that create th instead of td html tags the pagerev php script was refactored into separate functions to allow easier integration of recipes displaying the page history a couple of minor bugs were fixed and the documentation was updated version 2 2 9 2 2 10 2010 01 17 most important in this release is the official change of enablerelativepagevars to 1 the change is about how variable in included pages is understood by pmwiki when enablerelativepagevars is set to 0 name displays the name of the currently browsed page even if name is in an included page it will display the name of the browsed page when enablerelativepagevars is set to 1 name displays the name of the physical page where it written if name is in an included page it will display the name of the included page name always displays the name of the currently browsed page regardless of enablerelativepagevars so if your wiki relies on page variables from included pages and doesn t have enablerelativepagevars set to 1 after upgrading to 2 2 9 you can revert to the previous behavior by adding to config php such a line enablerelativepagevars 0 more information about page variables can be found at http www pmwiki org wiki pmwiki pagevariables this release adds a new variable enablepagetitlepriority which defines how to treat multiple title directives if set to 1 the first title directive will be used and if a page defines a title directives from included pages cannot override it pmwiki default is 0 for years the last title directive was used it could come from an included page or groupfooter this release also adds a new variable diffkeepnum specifying the minimum number default 20 of edits that will be kept even if some of them are older than the limit of diffkeepdays a number of bugs were fixed and the documentation was updated version 2 2 8 2009 12 07 this release fixes another php 5 3 compatibility issue with conditional markup the author field now handles apostrophes correctly the documentation was updated version 2 2 7 2009 11 08 this release fixes most php 5 3 compatibility issues unfortunately some specific builds for windows may still have problems which are unrelated to pmwiki notably on windows all passwords need to be 4 characters or longer upload names with spaces are now correctly quoted the documentation was updated version 2 2 6 2009 10 04 with this release it is now possible to display recently uploaded files to the recentchanges pages if you have been using the recentuploadslog recipe please uninstall it and follow the instructions at http www pmwiki org wiki cookbook recentuploadslog the release also introduces makeuploadnamepatterns to allow custom filename normalization for attachements it is now possible to replace pagelistfilters and fpltemplatefunctions with custom functions notify should now work in safe mode some bugs were fixed among which one with conditional markup with dates the documentation was updated version 2 2 5 2009 08 25 this release adds a new markup for pagelist templates template none which allows a message to be set when the search found no pages the fpltemplate function was broken into configurable sub parts to allow development hooks a number of bugs were fixed and the documentation was updated version 2 2 4 2009 07 16 this release fixes a bug introduced earlier today with html entities in xlpages version 2 2 3 2009 07 16 this release fixes six potential xss vulnerabilities reported by michael engelke the vulnerabilities may affect wikis open for editing and may allow the injection of external javascripts in their pages public open wikis should upgrade a new variable enableuploadgroupauth was added if set to 1 it allows password protected uploads to be checked against the group password it is now possible to use site edit site read site admin or site upload global passwords in groupattributes pages a number of other small bugs were fixed and the documentation was updated version 2 2 2 2009 06 21 the major news in this release is a fix of an authuser vulnerability the vulnerability affects only wikis that 1 rely on the authuser core module for user password authentication and 2 where the php installation runs with the variable magic quotes gpc disabled all pmwiki 2 1 x versions from pmwiki 2 1 beta6 on all 2 2 betax 2 2 0 and 2 2 1 are affected the pmwiki siteanalyzer can detect if your wiki needs to upgrade http www pmwiki org wiki pmwiki siteanalyzer if your wiki is vulnerable you should do one of the following at the earliest opportunity upgrade to a version of pmwiki at least 2 2 2 or greater turn on magic quotes gpc in the php ini file or in a htaccess file alternatively you can temporarily disable authuser until you upgrade note that even if your wiki does not have the authuser vulnerability at the moment you are strongly encouraged to upgrade to pmwiki version 2 2 2 or later as some future configuration of your hosting server might put you at risk this release also comes with minor updates in the local documentation fixes were applied for international wikis notably global variables in xlpage utf 8 php and a new variable enablenotifysubjectencode which allows e mail clients to correctly display the subject header and a number of other small bugs were fixed version 2 2 1 2009 03 28 this release comes with an updated local documentation wiki trails now work cross group guiedit php now produces valid html and other small bugs were fixed we also added enableredirectquiet which allows redirects to take place without any mention of redirected from page version 2 2 0 2009 01 18 this is a summary of changes from 2 1 x to 2 2 0 several pages that were formerly in the site group are now in a separate siteadmin group which is read restricted by default the affected pages include site authuser site authlist site notifylist site blocklist and site approvedurls if upgrading from an earlier version of pmwiki pmwiki will prompt to automatically copy these pages to their new location if needed if a site wishes to continue using the old site group for these pages simply set siteadmingroup sitegroup when carrying out this upgrade inspect your config files for lines such as blocklistdownload site blocklist pmwiki array format pmwiki as you may wish to fix then eg blocklistdownload siteadmingroup blocklist pmwiki array format pmwiki important change in passwords in pmwiki 2 2 indicating that the group can be edited even if a site password is set will be done by nopass prior it was done by nopass when migrating a wiki you will have to manually modify the permission or by a script replace in all the page concerned passwdread nopass by passwdread nopass see pits 00961 isidor pmwiki now ships with wikiwords entirely disabled by default to re enable them set either linkwikiwords or enablewikiwords to 1 to get the 2 1 behavior where wikiwords are spaced and parsed but don t form links use the following enablewikiwords 1 linkwikiwords 0 it s now easy to disable the rule that causes lines with leading spaces to be treated as preformatted text simply set enablewspre 0 to disable this rule important there is ongoing discussion that the leading whitespace rule may be disabled by default in a future versions of pmwiki if you want to make sure that the rule will continue to work in future upgrades set enablewspre 1 in local config php the rospatterns variable has changed somewhat replacement strings are no longer automatically passed through fmtpagename prior to substitution i e it must now be done explicitly page variables and page links inside of include pages are now treated as relative to the included page instead of the currently browsed page in short the idea is that links and page variables should be evaluated with respect to the page in which they are written as opposed to the page in which they appear this seems to be more in line with what authors expect there are a number of important ramifications of this change we now have a new var form of page variable which always refers to the currently displayed page pages such as site pageactions and site editform that are designed to work on the currently browsed page should generally switch to using fullname instead of fullname the enablerelativepagelinks and enablerelativepagevars settings control the treatment of links and page variables in included pages however to minimize disruption to existing sites enablerelativepagevars defaults to disabled this will give existing sites an opportunity to convert any absolute var references to be var instead eventually enablerelativepagevars will be enabled by default so we highly recommend setting enablerelativepagevars 1 in local config php to see how a site will react to the new interpretation administrators should especially check any customized versions of the following site pageactions site editform site pagenotfound sidebar pages with action links for the current page groupheaderfmt groupfooterfmt page lists that refer to the current group or page etc in sidebars headers and footers the include directive now has a basepage option whereby an author can explicitly specify the page upon which relative links and page variables should be based if no basepage option is specified the included page is assumed to be the base sites that want to retain the pre 2 2 behavior of include and other items can set transition version 2001900 to automatically retain the 2 1 x defaults text inserted via include can contain immediate substitutions of the form option these are substituted with the value of any options provided to the include directive pmwiki now recognizes when it is being accessed via https and switches its internal links appropriately this can be overridden by explicitly setting scripturl and pubdirurl a new enablelinkpagerelative option allows pmwiki to generate relative urls for page links instead of absolute urls draft handling capabilities have been greatly improved when enabledrafts is set then the save button is relabeled to publish and a save draft button appears in addition an enablepublishattr configuration variable adds a new publish authorization level to distinguish editing from publishing see pmwiki drafts for more details there is a new var page text variable available that is able to grab text excerpts out of markup content for example somepage xyz will be replaced by a definition of xyz in somepage page text variables can be defined using definition markup a line beginning with the variable name and a colon or a special directive form that doesn t display anything on output xyz some value definition list form xyz some value colon form xyz some value directive form the pagelist command can now filter pages based on the contents of page variables and or page text variables for example the following directive displays only those pages that have an xyz page text variable with some value pagelist xyz some value wildcards also work here thus the following pagelist command lists pages where the page s title starts with the letter a pagelist title a the if option to pagelist can be used to filter pages based on conditional markup pagelist if auth upload fullname pages with upload permission pagelist if date today name pages with names that are dates later than today spaces no longer separate wildcard patterns use commas most people have been doing this already because page variables are now relative the pagecount groupcount grouppagecount variables used in pagelist templates are now pagecount groupcount grouppagecount one can now use option in a pagelist template to obtain the value of any option provided to the pagelist command the pagelist directive no longer accepts parameters from urls or forms by default in order to have it accept such parameters which was the default in 2 1 and earlier add a request 1 option to the pagelist directive the count option to pagelists now accepts negative values to count from the end of the list thus count 5 returns the the first five pages in the list and count 5 returns the last five pages in the list in addition ranges of pages may be specified as in count 10 19 or count 10 5 pagelist templates may have special template first and template last sections to specify output for the first or last page in the list or a group there s also a template defaults to allow a template to specify default options pmwiki comes with an ability to cache the results of certain pagelist directives to speed up processing on subsequent visits to the page to enable this feature set pagelistcachedir to the name of a writable directory e g work d the if conditional markup now also understands elseif and else in addition markup can nest conditionals by placing digits after if elseif else as in if1 elseif1 else1 etc the if date conditional markup can now perform date comparisons for dates other than the current date and time wikitrails can now specify anchor identifiers to use only sections of pages as a trail a new if ontrail condition allows testing if a page is listed on a trail the extensions odt ods and odp from openoffice org are now recognized as valid attachment types by default a new blocklist capability has been added to the core distribution it allows blocking of posts based on ip address phrase or regular expression and can also make use of publicly available standard blocklists see pmwiki blocklist for details there is a new siteadmin authlist page that can display a summary of all password and permissions settings for pages on a site this page is restricted to administrators by default there are new passwdread passwdedit etc variables that display the current password settings for a page assuming the browser has attr permissions or whatever permissions are set in passwdvarauth forms creation via the input markup has been internally refactored somewhat and may still undergo some changes prior to 2 2 0 release the new input select markup can be used to create select boxes and input default can be used to set default control values including for radio buttons and checkboxes the input textarea markup now can take values from other sources including page text variables from other pages specifying focus 1 on an input control causes that control to receive the input focus when a page is loaded if a page has multiple controls requesting the focus then the first control with the lowest value of focus wins pmwiki now provides a scripts creole php module to enable creole standard markup to enable this add include once scripts creole php to a local customization file pmwiki adds a new markup expression capability which allows various simple string and data processing e g formatting of dates and times this is extensible so that recipe authors and system administrators can easily add custom expression operators it s now possible to configure pmwiki to automatically create category pages whenever a page is saved with category links and the corresponding category doesn t already exist pages are created only if the author has appropriate write permissions into the group to enable this behavior add the following to local config php autocreate category array ctime now sites with wikiwords enabled can now set wikiwordcount wikiword to 1 to indicate that wikiword should not be spaced according to spacewikiwords wikiwords that follow or are no longer treated as wikiwords links to non existent group home pages e g group and group will now go to the first valid entry of pagepathfmt instead of being hardcoded to group group for example to set pmwiki to default group home pages to defaultname use pagepathfmt array group 1 1 defaultname 1 1 pmwiki now provides a currenttimeiso and timeisofmt variables for specifying dates in iso format cookbook authors can use the internal pmwiki function updatepage temporarily documented at debuggingforcookbookauthors to change page text while preserving history diff information updating page revision numbers updating recentchanges pages sending email notifications etc skin templates are now required to have htmlheader and htmlfooter directives setting enableskindiag causes pmwiki to return an error if this isn t the case for a loaded skin skins that explicitly do not want htmlheader or htmlfooter sections can use nohtmlheader and nohtmlfooter to suppress the warning added a new pre wikistyle for preformatted text blocks the xlpage utf 8 php script now understands how to space utf 8 wikiwords searches on utf 8 site are now case insensitive for utf 8 characters many abort calls now provide a link to pages on pmwiki org that can explain the problem in more detail and provide troubleshooting assistance pmwiki no longer reports cannot acquire lockfile if the visitor is simply browsing pages or performing other read only actions the enablereadonly configuration variable can be set to signal pmwiki that it is to run in read only mode e g for distribution on read only media attempts to perform actions that write to the disk are either ignored or raise an error via abort including authuser php no longer automatically calls resolvepagename authentication using active directory is now simplified in site authuser or the authuser variable set ldap name of ad server with no additional path information see pmwiki authuser for more details pages are now saved with a charset attribute to identify the character set in effect when the page was saved the phpdiff php algorithm has been optimized to be smarter about finding smaller diffs removed the deprecated wikileft h1 and wikileft h5 styles from the pmwiki default skin the mailposts php and compat1x php scripts have been removed from the distribution version 2 1 27 2006 12 11 this version backports from 2 2 0 beta a bugfix for tablerowindexmax and also support for the variable markup version 2 1 26 2006 09 11 this version fixes a bug in feeds php that would cause feed entries to be mixed up version 2 1 25 2006 09 08 this release fixes a bug in authuser php introduced by the 2 1 24 release the skin template code has also been extended to allow xmlheader and xmlfooter as aliases for htmlheader and htmlfooter version 2 1 24 2006 09 06 this release makes some improvements and fixes to the authuser capability a bug in authuser php that had trouble dealing with non array values in authuser has been fixed it is now possible to specify group memberships from local config php remember that such entries must come before including the authuser php script alice and bob s passwords authuser alice crypt alicepassword authuser bob crypt bobpassword members of the writers and admins groups authuser writers array alice bob authuser admins array alice dave carol is a member of editors and writers authuser carol array editors writers authuser can now read from apache formatted htgroup files the location of the htgroup file can be done either in local config php or site authuser local config php authuser htgroup path to htgroup site authuser htgroup path to htgroup versions 2 1 21 2 1 22 2 1 23 2006 09 05 2006 09 06 this release closes a potential security vulnerability for sites that are running with register globals set to on details of the vulnerability will be forthcoming on the mailing list and site sites that are running with php register globals and allow url fopen set to on should upgrade to this release at the earliest opportunity if upgrading isn t an option contact pm for a patch to older versions there is now a tool available to analyze pmwiki sites for security and other configuration settings see pmwiki siteanalyzer version 2 1 23 also corrects a bug that prevented pmwiki from being able to read pagefiles created by versions of pmwiki before 0 5 6 version 2 1 20 2006 09 04 more minor bugfixes corrected a bug with wikiword references appearing in the attachlist markup restore ability to remove override pmwiki s default css settings version 2 1 19 2006 08 30 this release provides a number of very minor bugfixes and enhancements fixed a bug in the pageindex code that was causing it to not regenerate as quickly as it should fixed image object embed handling in wikistyles to better support the cookbook flash recipe fixed a bug with wikistyles and input form tags the next release s may have a number of substantial code enhancements and changes so this release simply closes out a few items before introducing those changes version 2 1 18 2006 08 28 this release closes a potential cross site scripting vulnerability that could allow authors to inject javascript code through the various table markups the release also adds a new input image markup to generate image input tags in forms finally this release corrects a problem with action print failing to properly set the action page variable version 2 1 17 2006 08 26 this release fixes a long standing bug with enableimscaching pits 00573 whereby login logout operations wouldn t invalidate browser caches causing some people to see versions of a page prior to the login logout taking place the new ims caching code maintains a imstime cookie in the visitor s browser that keeps track of the time of last login logout author name change or site modification this cookie is then used to determine the proper response to browser requests containing if modified since headers previously only the time of the last site modification was available browsers which do not accept cookies will effectively act as though ims caching is disabled version 2 1 16 2006 08 26 this release makes some improvements to skin handling primarily this improves the capability of relocating skin files to other locations and to provide the ability for recipes to insert items at the end of html output this release introduces a htmlfooter directive into skin templates which allows recipes and local customizations to insert output near the end of a document using a htmlfooterfmt array from php also the headertext directive which inserts the contents of htmlheaderfmt into the output has now been renamed to htmlheader pmwiki will continue to recognize headertext to preserve compatibility with existing skins but htmlheader is preferred a new skinlibdirs array has been introduced which allows the source locations and urls for skins to be specified from a customization file by default skinlibdirs is set as skinlibdirs array pub skins skin pubdirurl skins skin farmd pub skins skin farmpubdirurl skins skin the keys on the left indicate the places to look for a skin tmpl file in the filesystem while the values on the right indicate the url location of the skin css file modifying the value of skinlibdirs allows a skin tmpl file to be located anywhere on the filesystem as far as i can see none of the changes introduced by this release should have any sort of negative impact on existing sites so it should be safe to upgrade if i m wrong please let me know version 2 1 15 2006 08 25 this release includes a number of feature enhancements and code cleanups as reported or requested by administrators first authuser s ldap authentication system now allows the use of a filter parameter consistent with urls used for mod auth ldap authorization in apache see the newly updated ldap section of the authuser documentation for more details a chicken and egg problem with the site authorization groups has been resolved it s now possible to have a page s read authorization refer to things such as site edit also the retrieveauthpage function used for retrieving pages only if the visitor is authorized to do so now recognizes a special level parameter of always which means to always authorize access regardless of the browser or visitors current permissions this may be useful for allowing certain operations to take place from within trusted scripts without having to grant full authorization to the browser hardcoded instances of the local directory now use a customizable localdir variable this variable controls where pmwiki looks for local config php and per group customization files it may be useful for some wiki farm contexts note that this does not change or affect the location of farmd local farmconfig php some minor internal changes have been made to scripts wikistyles php to better accommodate the wikipublisher recipe it s probably better if we don t try to explain them version 2 1 13 2 1 14 2006 08 15 2006 08 16 this release fixes a bug in handling numeric passwords and also allows ldaps authentication sources version 2 1 12 2006 08 07 this version introduces the ability to nest divs and tables the standard table and div markups are still available except that a div may contain a table and vice versa as in previous versions of pmwiki the div markup automatically closes any previous div however there are now div1 div2 etc markups and the corresponding div1end div2end which can be used to uniquely distinguish divs for nesting purposes to restore pmwiki s previous non nested div behavior set transition nodivnest 1 in a local customization file other changes in this release add a noaction directive to suppress display of page actions allow anchor tags to contain colons hyphens and dots add white space as an allowed wikistyle other minor bug fixes and typographical corrections version 2 1 11 2006 06 09 this is a minor update that prevents define wikistyles from generating empty paragraphs in the html output prior to this release markup lines containing only wikistyle definitions would often generate empty paragraphs p p this release changes things so that a markup line beginning with define and containing only wikistyle definitions will not initiate a new paragraph version 2 1 10 2006 06 03 version 2 1 4 introduced an action page variable that would contain the current action value unfortunately this page variable conflicted with a pre existing action global variable that was being used by skins to display a human friendly form of the current action since there s not really a clean way to resolve this i ve decided to keep action as a page variable with the current action value as introduced in 2 1 4 and change the global for skins to be actiontitle this will require updating skins to use actiontitle instead of action i apologize for the conflict this release adds a site localtemplates page for the fmt xyz option in pagelist and search results the list of pages to be searched can be customized via the fpltemplatepagefmt variable the fmt xyz option will now also search the current page for a matching template before searching site localtemplates and site pagelisttemplates the pmwiki skin now places a span around the recent changes link in the header to make it somewhat easier to style version 2 1 9 2006 06 02 this release fixes a long standing and difficult to find bug with the handling of author links version 2 1 8 2006 06 01 this release simply changes the notifylistfmt variable to be notifylistpagefmt more descriptive and adds a notifylist array that can be used to specify notification entries from a configuration file version 2 1 7 2006 05 31 this release introduces a variety of improvements and bugfixes vspace paragraphs are now divs version 2 1 7 changes the way that pmwiki handles vertical space in output the infamous p class vspace p sequence instead of using paragraphs pmwiki now generates div class vspace div for vertical space sequences in addition pmwiki is able to collapse the vspace div with any subsequent paragraph tags such that a sequence like div class vspace div p paragraph text p is automatically converted to p class vspace paragraph text p this allows for better control over paragraph spacing it is expected that this change in vspace handling will not have any detrimental effects on existing sites sites that have set custom values for htmlvspace will continue to use the custom value a site that wants to restore pmwiki s earlier handling of vspace can do so by adding the following to local config php htmlvspace p class vspace p improved email notifications of changes version 2 1 7 incorporates a notify php script that provides improved capabilities for sending email notifications in response to page changes this script is intended to replace the previous mailposts capability which is now deprecated but will continue to be supported in pmwiki 2 1 x details and instructions for using notify php are in the pmwiki notify page added group home page syntax a group name followed by only a dot or slash is automatically treated as a reference to the group s home page whatever it happens to be this simplifies some pagelist templates as well as a number of other items in particular group links in pagelist output now points to the correct locations instead of being a page in the current group several bugs and vulnerabilities have been fixed the default width of edit forms is now more appropriate for internet explorer authentication failure messages from ldap are now suppressed some cross site scripting vulnerabilities in uploads and page links have been corrected courtesy moritz naumann http moritz naumann com a problem with invalid pagenames resulting in redirect loops has been corrected version 2 1 6 2006 05 22 the primary improvement in this release is the addition of a pagename argument to the if auth conditional markup thus one can display markup based on a visitor s authorization to a page other than the current one for example to test for edit privileges to main wikisandbox one would use if auth edit main wikisandbox as before if the pagename is omitted the directive tests authorization to the current page this release also restores the ability to have hyphens in intermap link names lastly the release closes a potential cross site scripting vulnerability in the wikitrail markup and provides some small performance improvements version 2 1 4 2 1 5 2006 03 29 this release fixes a few more bugs pagelist based feeds using action rss work again multi term searches with special characters is fixed the release also adds a couple of items there is now an action page variable usernames and passwords submitted to authuser php can contain quotes the attachlist command now uses a natural case sort version 2 1 3 2006 03 17 this release fixes a bug that prevents the lines option from working on sites running php 5 1 1 or later it also re fixes a bug involving empty passwords and ldap authentication version 2 1 2 2006 03 16 this release fixes a bug with handling nopass passwords it also makes some speed improvements to large web feeds and fixes a couple of minor html tag mismatches version 2 1 1 2006 03 13 this release primarily fixes a bug with passwords containing multiple authorization groups and in the process slightly liberalized the formatting of group and id name handling this release also adds a new mechanism for managing and displaying faq pages version 2 1 0 2006 03 12 this set of release notes is fairly lengthy as it chronicles all of the changes since 2 0 13 four months of development a lot remains the same but some changes warrant extra care when upgrading from a 2 0 x version to 2 1 0 thus the major revision number change as always questions and issues can be mailed to the pmwiki users mailing list here s the list wikiwords are now disabled by default to enable them set linkwikiwords 1 in a local customization file as of 2 1 beta2 you can now leave wikiwords enabled but have links to non existent pages display without decoration to do this place the following lines in pub css local css span wikiword a createlink display none span wikiword a createlinktext border bottom none text decoration none color inherit the pagelist code has been substantially revised pagelist formatting can now be specified using markup and several defaults are available from site pagelisttemplates also several built in pagelist formatting functions fplsimple fplbygroup fplgroup are now removed in favor of the template code the fplbygroup function can be restored by setting transition fplbygroup 1 remark check to see if your page site pagelisttemplates is not passwordprotected for viewing otherwise the resulting pagelist will not be shown pagelist now also understands wildcards in group and name arguments as well as excluding specific names and groups pagelist now has an order random option searchbox now accepts group link list etc options to be passed along to the search results it also accepts a target option that identifies the page on which to send the search query action search will display the contents of the current page if it contains a searchresults directive otherwise it uses the content of the page identified by pagesearchform default is the search page for the current language translation pmwiki no longer maintains a linkindex file it now has a pageindex file that contains not only a table of links but also words used in each page to speed up term searches the maintenance of the pageindex file can be disabled by setting pageindexfile the enablepagelistprotect variable now defaults to true so that read only pages appear in pagelists only if the visitor has read authorization note that this can also slow down some pagelist and search commands so if the site doesn t have any read only pages or if you aren t worried with cloaking read only pages from searchlists it might be worth setting enablepagelistprotect 0 whitespace indentation rules now exist and are enabled by default any line that begins with whitespace and aligns with a previous list item is considered to be within that list item text folds and wraps as normal and the linebreaks directive is honored to turn off whitespace indentation use disablemarkup ws a single blank line after a heading is silently ignored the redirect directive is now a true markup and can be embedded inside conditional markups or includes it also allows redirecting to an anchor in a page such as redirect pagename anchor a new from option allows the redirect to take place only from pages that match the given wildcard specification the status option allows a 301 302 303 or 307 http status code to be returned the built in authorization function has gone through some substantial internal changes however these changes should be fully backward compatible so that it doesn t impact any existing sites if it does cause a problem please let me know so i can investigate why the password prompts are now specified by an admin customizable site authform page in addition the authorization function no longer creates php sessions for visitors that aren t being authenticated the authuser php has likewise been substantially updated the new version should have complete backwards compatibility with previous authuser php settings but this version also offers the ability to configure authentication resources and authorization groups through the site authuser page note that by default the site authuser page can only be edited using the admin password the enablesessionpasswords variable can be used to control whether passwords are held in php sessions this does not affect user authentication via authuser however the author variable now defaults to authid if not otherwise set by a script or cookie the site sidebar page now defaults its edit password to the sitewide edit password in defaultpasswords edit pmwiki now supports a draft edit mode enabled by enabledrafts 1 this creates a save as draft button that will save a page under a draft suffix for intermediate edits there is now an action login action available a potential security vulnerability for sites running php 5 with register globals enabled has been fixed the pagename markup is now available by default this creates a link to pagename and uses that page s title as the link text what used to be markup variables are now page variables these are always specified using the variable syntax and can be used in markup and in fmt strings in addition one can request a value for a specific page by placing the pagename in front of the variable as in pagename variable the scripts rss php script is now scripts feeds php and is a complete redesign for web feed generation the new version supports utf 8 and other encodings can generate atom 1 0 action atom dublin core metadata action dc output and enclosures for podcasting it also allows feeds to be generated from trails groups categories and backlinks and provides options same as pagelists for sorting and filtering the contents of the feed most sites can simply switch to using include once scripts feeds php instead of the previous rss php include the rss php file has been removed from the distribution but still works with pmwiki 2 1 for those sites that wish to continue using it intermap entries can now come from a site intermap page as well as the local localmap txt and local farmmap txt files the format of these files has changed slightly in that the intermap name should now have a colon after it previously the colon was omitted we can now provide better control of robot webcrawler interactions with a site to reduce server load and bandwidth the robotpattern variable is used to detect robots based on the user agent string and any actions not listed in the robotactions array will return a 403 forbidden response to robots in addition setting enablerobotcloakactions will eliminate any forbidden action values from page links returned to robots which will reduce bandwidth loads from robots even further pits 00563 non existent page handling has been improved whenever a browser hits a non existent page pmwiki returns the contents of site pagenotfound and a 404 not found status code page links that have action in their query arguments are now treated as existing page links even if the page does not exist the pmwiki default skin now adds rel nofollow to various action links some of the css styles in the pmwiki default skin have been changed for better presentation the gui edit buttons have transparent instead of white borders so they integrate better into skins the enableimscaching variable is now much smarter it can detect changes in local customization files as well as pages wikistyles can now make percentage specifications by using pct to mean class attributes in wikistyle shortcuts are now cumulative so that class1 class2 results in class class1 class2 instead of just class class2 in the output a problem with the include pagename from markup not working has been fixed pits 00560 viewing a groupheader or groupfooter page no longer displays the contents twice it s now easier to share pages among multiple sites e g wikifarms see cookbook sharedpages pits 00459 a problem with nested apostrophe markups has been fixed pits 00590 pmwiki is now smarter about not surrounding block html tags with p p tags if an anchor is used more than once in a page only the first generates an actual anchor to preserve xhtml validity there are now if equal and if exists pagename conditional markups compound conditional markup expressions are now possible e g if group pmwiki name pmwiki added an inputvalues array that can supply default values for certain form controls pits 00566 the default setting of uploadurlfmt is now based on pubdirurl instead of scripturl the text global variable has been removed use get text post text or request text a possible problem with url encoding of attachments with non ascii characters has been addressed pits 00588 page actions in non existent pages no longer display with non existent link decorations a readme txt file has been added and several documentation files are now available through the docs directory pmwiki is no longer available through cvs on sourceforge net it is now available via svn on pmwiki org at svn pmwiki org pmwiki tags latest for more details see pmwiki subversion the newlinexxx variable deprecated in 2 0 0 has been removed there is experimental support for server side caching of pages that take a long time to render this is currently an unsupported feature and may be removed in future releases wiki administrators should note that from this release on pmwiki defaults to having wikiwords disabled to make sure wikiwords are enabled use

sli pmwiki groupcustomizations classes group research publications code login pmwiki groupcustomizations redirected from pmwiki pergroupcustomizations local customizations documentation index skins administrators intermediate one of the purposes of wiki groups is to allow a wiki administrator to customize the features of pmwiki on a per group basis here is where per group customizations come into play the local subdirectory is used to hold local configuration files the pub css subdirectory is used to hold local css files to perform local customizations for a particular wikigroup place the customizations in a file called groupname php where groupname is the actual name of the page group in question in the local subdirectory place the css customizations in a file called groupname css where groupname is the actual name of the page group in question in the pub css subdirectory these files will be automatically processed after processing any local customizations in the config php and local css files for example to change the image displayed in the upper left corner of pages in the groupname wikigroup one could create local groupname php containing php pagelogourl myimages chess gif the example s effect would cause all pages in the groupname wiki group to use myimages chess gif as the logo image instead of the default to add markup to the beginning or end of each page in a wiki group see group headers per page customizations pmwiki also allows per page customizations simply use the full name of the page to be customized instead of the group for example one can use the file local chess homepage php to set local customizations for chess homepage almost any customization that would be placed in config php can be used as a per group or per page customization an important exception to this is setting per group or per page customizations for recipe scripts included in config php most recipe scripts would need any customization variables defined before the script is included instead of using a per group or per page customization php file use a per group or per page conditional statement in config php before including the recipe script example page pagevar pagename fullname group pagevar pagename group per group customizations if group groupname recipevariable valuea etc per page customizations if page groupname pagename recipevariable valueb etc include recipe after variables are set include once cookbook recipescript php note that this method cannot be used to set defaultpasswords you should use group or page attributes see passwords and passwordsadmin for more information processing order for all local customizations pmwiki first processes the local config php file and then looks for a per page customization file in the local subdirectory to process followed by any per group customization file if no per page or per group customizations are loaded then pmwiki loads local default php if a per page customization wants to have the per group customizations loaded first it can do so directly by using php s include once function for more information see wiki cascades custom css styles per group or per page to apply css styles to pages of a specific group named group name create a file named groupname css in the pub css directory and add the css style rules there to apply styles to a specific page create a file groupname pagename css in this directory with your style rules any css rules to be applied for all wiki pages can be put into pub css local css pub css groupname css body background f4c4b4 preventing group level configurations any customization file can set enablepgcust 0 to prevent later page group default customizations from being automatically loaded if a per page customization needs to have the per group customizations loaded first it can do so directly by using php s include once function authentication any passwords required for a group should be set in the group s group attributes page see passwords administration and not in a group customization file consider wiki farms wiki groups are an easy way to host multiple sites in a single pmwiki installation by giving each site its own group another approach is to use wiki farms which allows each site to have its own set of wiki group and local customization files read about if you are looking for nested group levels you may want to consider pm s design considerations on hierarchical groups how can i apply css styles to a particular group or page simply create a pub css group css or pub css group page css file containing the custom css styles for that group or page see also cookbook localcss why shouldn t passwords be set in group or page customization files why shouldn t group or page passwords be set in config php the reason for this advice is that per group customization files are only loaded for the current page so if defaultpasswords read is set in local groupa php then someone could use a page in another group to view the contents of pages in groupa for example main wikisandbox could contain include groupa somepage and because the groupa php file wasn t loaded we re looking at main wikisandbox local main php there s no read password set the same is true for page customization files isn t that processing order strange why not load per page configuration last that is after global configuration an per group configuration many times what we want to do is to enable a certain capability for a group of pages but disable it on a specific page as if it was never enabled if the per group config file is processed first then it becomes very difficult tedious for the per page one to undo the effects of the per group page so we load the per page file before the per group if a per page customization wants the per group customizations to be performed first it can use the techniques given above using include once or setting enablepgcust 0 local customizations documentation index skins this page may

sli pmwiki pathvariables classes group research publications code login pmwiki pathvariables pagelist variables variables security variables when dealing with file or path variables one has to recognize the difference between working with urls and files on disk for example the include statements are used to include other files on disk into the currently running pmwiki script thus they require paths on the server s filesystem the scripturl and pubdirurl variables are used to tell a browser connecting via the webserver how to execute the pmwiki script scripturl and the base url for getting files from pmwiki s pub directory pubdirurl note that a browser needs a url http example com pmwiki pub while an include statement requires a server file path farmd scripts something php farmd the directory on the server where the farm is located i e the directory containing the farm s copy of pmwiki php and the scripts directory this directory is automatically determined by pmwiki php when it runs and can be used to distinguish the farm s cookbook and pub subdirectories from a field s subdirectories farmpubdirurl is the url that refers to the pub directory for an entire farm it defaults to the same value as pubdirurl pagecsslistfmt is an associative array which pmwiki uses to find any local css configuration files it consists of a set of key value pairs that point to the same file the key is a possible path to a file on disk holding the css data while the value is the coresponding url for that same file they keys are tested in turn and for each named file that exists the browser is instructed to load the corresponding url this allows for pmwiki to only load the css file if it exists why see if a css exists the default value for this variable is pagecsslistfmt array pub css local css pubdirurl css local css pub css group css pubdirurl css group css pub css fullname css pubdirurl css fullname css note that the default as of version pmwiki 2 1 beta26 makes no reference to farmpubdirurl for css configuration files if you wish to be able to place css configuration files in both the field s pub directory and the farm s pub directory you may want to add these lines to your local config php file as described in cookbook sharedpages this adds farm css to all wikis pagecsslistfmt array farmd pub css farm css farmpubdirurl css farm css pub css local css

including associated css can be put in either the farm or the field pub skins directory and the program will find them pubdirurl is the url that refers to the pub directory that directory contains all the files and subdirectories that must be directly accessible from a browser e g css and html files most prominent here is the skins subdirectory the following may work for you 1 scripturl http server http host pmwiki pmwiki php pubdirurl http server http host pmwiki pub http sli ics uci edu scripturl is the url that you want people s browsers to use when accessing pmwiki either as a field or farm it s used whenever pmwiki needs to generate a link to another pmwiki page or action pmwiki is usually fairly good about guessing the correct value for scripturl on its own but sometimes an admin needs to set it explicitly because of url manipulations by the webserver such as cookbook cleanurls mod rewrite bizarre php configurations and so on skindirset by scripts skins php to be the base url of the current skin s directory i e within a pub skins directory this variable is typically used inside of a skin tmpl file to provide access to css files and graphic images associated with the skin see security note regarding use skindirurlset by scripts skins php to be the base path of the current skin s directory i e within a pub skins directory this variable is typically used inside of a skin tmpl file to provide access to secondary files see security note regarding use workdir this variable is a string that gives a local path to a directory where the pmwiki engine can create temporary files etc pmwiki needs this for a variety of things such as building merged edits caching mailposts entries keeping track of the last modification time of the site other types of cache etc do not confuse this variable with wikidir the reason that both workdir and wikidir refer by default to the directory wiki d is merely to simplify things for the administrator wikidir a pagestore object that refers to how wiki pages are stored this can be a simple reference to a directory typically wiki d or something more advanced such as a mysql backend or a dbm file do not confuse this variable with

sli pmwiki passwords classes group research publications code login pmwiki passwords page history documentation index categories authors table of contents protect an individual page protect a group of pages protect the site pmwiki has built in support for password protecting various areas of the wiki site authors generally want to be able to apply passwords to individual pages or to wiki groups wiki administrators can apply passwords to individual pages to wiki groups or to the entire site setting an edit password on a page or group or the entire site is one of the most common ways to stop spam as with any access control system the password protection mechanisms described here are only a small part of overall system and wiki security as an author editing pages an author will generally set 3 types of passwords to control who can see a page or group use read passwords to control who can edit a page or group use edit passwords to control who can alter the passwords used to protect a page or group use attr passwords if required most page actions can be password protected protect an individual page to set a password on an individual wiki page add the page action action attr to the page s url address to access its attributes using the form on the attributes page you can set or clear the read edit or attr passwords on the page in the form you enter the passwords as cleartext pmwiki encrypts them for you automatically when it stores them additional options leaving a field blank will leave the attribute unchanged to remove a password from a page reverting back to the group s or site s default enter clear to indicate that the page can be edited even if a group or site password is set enter nopass to lock a page for everybody but the admin enter lock to assign the site s site wide passwords to the read edit or attr password for the page enter site edit site read or site upload protect a wiki group of pages to set a password on a wiki group is slightly more difficult you just set the passwords on a special page in each group called groupattributes first you can get to the attributes page for groupattributes by entering a url address like http example com pmwiki pmwiki php n groupname groupattributes action attr replace example com with your domain name and groupname with the name of the group then using the form on the attributes page you can set or clear the read edit or attr passwords for the entire group in the form you enter the passwords as cleartext pmwiki encrypts them for you automatically additional options to remove a password from a group reverting back to the site s default enter clear to indicate that the group can be edited even if a site password is set enter nopass to lock a group for everybody but the admin enter lock beginning with ver 2 2 3 to assign the site s site wide passwords to the read edit or attr password for the group enter site edit site read or site upload passwords passwords may consist of any combination of characters except double quotes or apostrophes passwords with spaces or colons must be entered using quotes eg foo bar or foo bar obviously longer is better and on some systems passwords need to have 4 or more characters multiple passwords multiple passwords for a page group or site are allowed simply enter multiple passwords separated by a space this allows you to have a read password a write password and have the write password allow read write access in other words if the read password is alpha and the edit password is beta then enter set new read password alpha beta set new edit password beta this says that either alpha or beta can be used to read pages but only beta may edit since pmwiki checks the passwords you ve entered since the browser has been opened entering a read password that is also a write password allows both reading and writing protect the site passwords can be applied to the entire wiki website in config php see passwords administration for details administrator as an administrator you can set passwords on pages and groups exactly as described above for authors you can also set site wide passwords for pages and groups that do not have passwords use attr passwords to control who is able to set passwords on pages use upload passwords to control access to the file upload capabilities if uploads are enabled use an admin password to override the passwords set for any individual page or group use siteadmin authlist to view the permissions settings for pages that have permissions set for more information on password options available to administrators see passwordsadmin which password wins in pmwiki page passwords override group passwords group passwords override the default passwords and the admin password overrides all passwords this gives a great deal of flexibility in controlling access to wiki pages in pmwiki the special page siteadmin authlist is a page list of all pages with access permissions set opening access to pages in protected groups sites sometimes we want to unprotect pages in a group or site that is otherwise protected in these cases the special password nopass is used to indicate that access should be allowed to a page without requiring a password for example suppose main groupattributes has an edit password set thus restricting the editing of all pages in main now we want main wikisandbox to be editable without a password using clear for the edit password for main wikisandbox doesn t unprotect the page because the password is being set by the group instead we set the edit password for main wikisandbox to the special value nopass which tells pmwiki to ignore any site wide or group level passwords for that page how can i password protect all the pages and groups on my site do i really have to set passwords page by page or group by group administrators can set passwords for the entire site by editing the config php file they don t have to set passwords for each page or group for example to set the entire site to be editable only by those who know an edit password an administrator can add a line like the following to local config php defaultpasswords edit pmcrypt edit password for more information about the password options that are available only to administrators see passwordsadmin i get http error 500 internal server error when i try to log in what s wrong this can happen if the encrypted passwords are not created on the web server that hosts the pmwiki the php crypt function changed during the php development e g a password encrypted with php 5 2 can not be decrypted in php 5 1 but php 5 2 can decrypt passwords created by php 5 1 this situation normally happens if you prepare everything on your local machine with the latest php version and you upload the passwords to a webserver which is running an older version the same error occurs when you add encrypted passwords to local config php solution create the passwords on the system with the oldest php version and use them on all other systems how can i create private groups for users so that each user can edit pages in their group but no one else other than the admin can modify the edit attribute for each group to id username e g set the edit attribute in janedoe groupattributes to id janedoe there is a more automatic solution but it s probably not a good idea for most wikis administrators can use the authuser recipe and add the following few lines to their local config php file to set this up group fmtpagename group pagename defaultpasswords edit id group include once farmd scripts authuser php this automatically gives edit rights to a group to every user who has the same user name as the group name unfortunately it also gives edit rights to such a user who is visiting a same named group not just for pages in that group but for any page on the wiki that relies on the site s default edit password this can create security holes how come when i switch to another wiki within a farm i keep my same authorization pmwiki uses php sessions to keep track of authentication authorization information and by default php sets things up such that all interactions with the same server are considered part of the same session an easy way to fix this is to make sure each wiki is using a different cookie name for its session identifier near the top of one of the wiki s local config php files before calling authuser or any other recipes add a line like session name xyzsessid you can pick any alphanumeric name for xyzsessid for example for the cs559 1 wiki you might choose session name cs559sessid this will keep the two wikis sessions independent of each other is it possible to test the password level for display and or if condition example if writerpassword display edit link

variables are used to specify the context of the variable when the variable is included into a destination target page the variable is used in a sidebar header or footer prefixing the variable name

ways to define automated page text variables more patterns can be defined if needed use a definition list the normal pmwiki markup for a definition list will create a page text variable example definition list name crisses name name crisses crisses this creates a new variable that can be accessed by name becomes crisses in the page use a simple colon delimiter in normal text example colon delimited address 1313 mockingbird lane address address 1313 mockingbird lane 1313 mockingbird lane this creates the address variable variable markup becomes 1313 mockingbird lane in the page hidden directive form pmwiki markup that doesn t render on the page but defines the variable example directive country transylvania country transylvania this creates the country variable variable markup becomes transylvania in the page usage usage on the same page on the same page you can resolve page text variables through the var format shown above usage in headers and footers special references if you want a groupheader groupfooter sidebar etc to call on page text variable in the main page you need to include special reference information to explicitly reference the page text variable from the

text variable directive as opposed to other ways of specifying ptvs will not be cached as a link on the page and thus won t be seen by pagelist s link option if you want the link to be found by link you need to specify the ptv using non directive markup or else put the link on the page even if it s hidden within a false conditional linkme pagetolink if false linkme ifend the page text variable value is always the text that is written in the page it is only evaluated when the variable is printed output to html to sort by a page text variable variable all values in all pages are the not yet

sli pmwiki pagelisttemplates classes group research publications code login pmwiki pagelisttemplates default page list templates pmwiki s default templates for page lists are in site pagelisttemplates which is replaced during upgrades these default templates can be supplemented or overridden with custom templates stored in other locations if the page name is not specified as part of the template name pmwiki s default configuration looks for templates in the following locations in the following order the current page site localtemplates site pagelisttemplates administrators can change those locations by using the fpltemplatepagefmt variable if the template is on the current page the current page must be saved for changes involving the template to show up preview alone will not work custom page list templates custom templates are used in the same way as default templates by referencing the desired format with the fmt anchor option there are several ways to indicate which template to use fmt custom uses the custom section from the current page site localtemplates or site pagelisttemplates sections are denoted by custom anchors fmt mytemplatepage custom uses a custom format from page mytemplatepage from its custom section fmt mytemplatepage uses a custom format from the entire page mytemplatepage fmt custom uses custom format which is defined in a cookbook script as custom see cookbook pagelisttemplatesamples for examples of custom pagelist formats creating page list templates a pagelist template contains standard pmwiki markup when creating pagelist output pmwiki iterates over each page returned from the pagelist and will include the pagelist template markup once for every page in the list special references during the page list iteration pmwiki sets 3 special page references and these special page references are updated on each pagelist iteration and can be used with the page variables syntax such as variable to define a pagelist template which will format the pagelist output the meaning of the special references are current pageso title displays the title of the current page in the iteration previous pageso group displays the group of the previous page in the iteration next pageso name displays the name of the next page in the iteration the and references are most useful to help structure pagelist output before and after the actual pagelist some common tests used to structure pagelist output are template first if equal group iteration is at the beginning of list template last if equal group iteration is at the end of list template first group if equal group group iteration is at the first item in a group template last group if equal group group iteration is at the last item in a group template defaults default options to be used in the pagelist command template each signifies the repeated part note the markup in column 2 is deprecated see also page variable special references page list template special markup pagelist templates may have special sections template first and template first template last and template last to specify output for the first or last page in the list or a group use first and last for output except for the first last page there s also a template defaults to allow a template to specify default options template each to signify the repeated part and template none whose content will appear if no page was found from version 2 2 5 these allow pagelist templates to be easily separated into sections that are included or not included in the output based on a variety of conditions these are intended to be improved versions of the if conditions that have traditionally been used to control pagelist output however the if conditions still work as before first each last none the simplest versions of the directives are template first markup to display only for first page in list template first markup to display for every page in list but the first template each markup to display for each page in list template last markup to display only on last page in list template last markup to display for every page in list but the last template none markup to display only if no pages were found so a pagelist template can specify template first pages in the list template each fullname fullname summary template last displayed pagecount pages in addition the first and last options can have control break arguments that identify markup to be displayed on the first or last page within a particular control section for example to specify markup to be displayed upon reaching the first or last page of a group one can use template first group template last group thus instead of writing control breaks using directives as in if equal group group group group ifend fullname one can now write template first group group group template each fullname page text variables and page variables can also be used for example template default maintainer order maintainer name template first maintainer default options in addition a template may specify default options to be used in the pagelist command for example a pagelist template to display a list of pages by their titles and sorted by title might use bytitle template defaults order title fullname bytitleend then an author could write pagelist fmt bytitle and the pages would automatically be sorted by title without having to specify an additional order title option to the pagelist directive to specify multiple parameters to an option enclose the parameters in double quotes eg to sort by a page text variable and then the page name template defaults order database name examples template defaults default options for pagelists using this template template each markup for each page in the pagelist template first markup output only for the first page in the pagelist template last markup output only for the last page in the pagelist template first group markup output only for a page where the value of group has just changed template last group markup output only for a page where the value of group will change with the next page so we have template template defaults order name template first pages ordered by group template first group pages in group group template each fullname template last group group contains grouppagecount pages template last pagecount pages total templateend page list template additional page variables additional page variables that are only available during pagelist are pagecount the current page count of this iteration groupcount the current group count of this iteration grouppagecount the current page count within the current group of this iteration option the argument option values from pagelist use of option for example trail returns the page name entered in the trail option of the pagelist directive you can make up custom options with no other purpose than being displayed in the pagelist redirect to enable searches that return only one page to automatically redirect to that page add the following to a pagelist template where the jump to a page functionality is desired template last if equal pagecount 1 redirect fullname ifend closure of markup any open tables divs or other structures inside of pagelist are by default automatically closed at the end of the pagelist command in other words pagelist acts like its own complete page as opposed to generating markup that is then inserted into the enclosing page for example a table generated by the cell directive in the first pagelist command is automatically closed at the end of the pagelist the cell in the second pagelist command then starts a new table note that the table directive doesn t actually start a new table it s the cell or cellnr directive that does it all that the table directive does is set attributes for any tables that follow usage it is advisable to not modify the page site pagelisttemplates directly so that you will still benefit from upgrades instead modify your site localtemplates page which is not part of the pmwiki distribution cookbook pagelisttemplatesamples has many examples of custom pagelist formats other recipes in addition the cookbook has other recipes for special fmt options including

sli pmwiki pagelists classes group research publications code login pmwiki pagelists categories documentation index deleting pages authors admins intermediate pmwiki comes with two directives for generating lists of pages pagelist and searchresults both directives are basically the same and each accepts the parameters documented below the primary difference between the two is that searchresults generates the results of search for and pages found out of searched messages around the results the searchbox directive generates a search form input text box to submit search queries the markup generally accepts the same parameters as pagelist which makes it possible to restrict order and format searchresults in the same ways that are described below for a pagelist for more information about the searchbox directive and the ways in which it differs from a pagelist skip to the section below basic syntax pagelist without any arguments shows a bulleted list of all pages as links ordered alphabetically and in groups pagelist group ab name cd fmt template list ef order gh count 123 link ij trail kl wrap mn passwd op if qr ptv st pv uv cache 0 argument1 argument2 etc variable value class class request 1 req 1 shows a pagelist according to the parameters supplied parameters are optional searchbox value abc size 99 target def label label searchresults parameters any argument supplied within pagelist that isn t in the form key value is treated as text that either must or must not exist in the page text the minus sign can be used to indicate things that should be excluded thus pagelist trail pmwiki documentationindex list normal apple pie lists all normal pages listed in the documentation index trail that contain the word apple but not pie with page text variables you can also use page text variables as a key to list pages according to the existence of a page text variable eg pagelist pagetextvar avalue lists pages having pagetextvar set to avalue minus sign wildcards and a comma separated list of values also works when specifying a selection based on pagetextvariables eg pagelist apagetextvar t test lists pages having apagetextvar like t but not test examples ptv is set is not empty pagelist mypagetextvariable ptv is empty or not set ie is not set to one char followed by 0 or more chars pagelist mypagetextvariable ptv is not value pagelist mypagetextvariable value ptv is set and not yes pagelist mypagetextvariable yes be aware that if using pagelist myptv yourptv ptvs include pmwiki formatting so you may not get the matches you expect currently the only way around this is to use wild cards so if the formatting is embedded you may be out of luck note pagelist does not evaluate markupexpressions when working with ptvs so if your page text variables is defined using a markup expression to set the value pagelist will see the literal values of the text of your markup expression rather than the result of your expression e g the ptv definition foo substr abcdef 2 4 will be seen by pagelist as an open curly brace followed by an open paren followed by s u b s t r etc rather than being seen as b c d e any processing of the markup expression in the output of your pagelist occurs in subsequent rules after pagelist within the context of the current page and thus these values cannot be used for sorting or selecting pages source with page variables pv page variables can be used within pagelists in the same way as page text variables see page text variables above for more details simply use var instead of var group and name the group and name parameters limit results to pages in a specific group or with a specific name all pages in the pmwiki group pagelist group pmwiki all pages except those in the pmwiki or site groups pagelist group pmwiki site all recentchanges pages pagelist name recentchanges all pages except recentchanges pagelist name recentchanges wildcards name and group parameters can contain wildcard characters that display only pages matching a given pattern an asterisk represents zero or more characters a question mark represents exactly one character examples all pages in any group beginning with pmwiki pagelist group pmwiki all pages in any group beginning with pmwiki except for chinese pagelist group pmwiki pmwikizh all pages in the pmcal group with names starting with 2005 pagelist name pmcal 2005 all cookbooks with names beginning with a a and a b letter note the different separators used for the same result pagelist group cookbook name a b pagelist group cookbook name a b pagelist group cookbook name ab pagelist group cookbook name ab if you want to use multiples conditions in name you need to use quotes or commas to delimit the string for example key one value another value trail the trail option obtains the list of pages to be displayed from a wikitrail display pages in the documentation by modification time pagelist trail pmwiki documentationindex order time display five most recently changed pages pagelist trail recentchanges count 5 list the list option allows a search to include or exclude pages according to predefined patterns set by the administrator list normal is predefined and which excludes things like allrecentchanges recentchanges groupheader groupfooter groupattributes and the like from being displayed in the list results note that list normal also excludes the current page list all over rides a default list that may be set by the wiki s administrator to exclude groups such as pmwiki or site from regular search results wiki administrators can define custom lists via the searchpatterns array see cookbook searchresults fmt the fmt option determines how the resulting list should be displayed pmwiki predefines several formats fmt bygroup display pages within groups default format fmt simple display a simple ordered list of pages in the form group name fmt title display a list of pages by page title use order title to have them sorted by title default is to order by page name fmt titlespaced display a list of pages by page title like above but with spaces between the words in the title fmt group display a list of wikigroups without listing the pages in the groups fmt include display the contents of each page in the list note this could take a very long time for long lists these formats are defined by page list templates which can be customized this format is not predefined by a page list template fmt count display the number of pages in the list note the absence of the in a trail fmt count counts existing and non existing pages to limit count to existing pages use if exists fullname fmt count mailing list link the link option implements backlinks i e it returns a list of pages with a link to the target it s especially useful for category pages and finding related pages all pages with a link to pmwiki documentationindex pagelist link pmwiki documentationindex all pages with links to the current page pagelist link fullname all pages in the skins category pagelist link category skins note that the link parameter doesn t accept multiple or negative targets and wildcard lists for these see cookbook pagelistmultitargets also link will ignore the directives if include redirect pagelist and page text variable directives while searching for links in a page that means links in included pages will not be found and links inside non displayed conditional markup will be found see pagetextvariables for ways to hide a link on a page while still allowing link to find it count the count option provides the ability to limit the pagelist to a specific number of pages subsets of a list return items from the end of a list subsets of a list display pages in reverse sequence a simple bullet list of ten most recently modified pages pagelist trail site allrecentchanges count 10 fmt simple display the first ten pages of a list count 10 display the first ten pages of list negative numbers specify pages to be displayed from the end of the list count 10 display last ten pages of list ranges may be specified using thus count 1 10 first ten pages of list count 5 10 5th through 10th pages of list negative numbers in ranges count from the end of the list count 10 5 10th from end 9th from end 5th from end omitting the start or end of the range uses the start or end of the list count 10 skip first ten pages count 10 1st through 10th page of list count 10 last ten pages of list count 10 all but the last nine pages ranges can be reversed indicating that the order of pages in the output should likewise be reversed count 5 10 5th through 10th pages of list count 10 5 same as 5 10 but in reverse sequence count 1 1 all pages in reverse sequence reverse sequence here refers to the sequence after any sorting has taken place therefore the three directives to the right are equivalent pagelist order name count 10 pagelist order name count 1 10 pagelist order name count 1 10 wrap the wrap option has the values none and inline with wrap inline and wrap none the output from pagelist markup or html is directly embedded in a page s markup without any surrounding div class div tags with wrap inline any surrounding ul is continued without wrap inline the html output starts a new ul this is important if you want to get a second level ul produced by the page list since starting a new ul with doesn t yield a second level ul but dl dd ul wrap inline likely has other effects since it suppresses the call to fpltemplatemarkupfunction being markuptohtml by default class by default a pagelist has the fpltemplate class the bygroup simple group and title page list formats have specific class names fplbygroup fplsimple etc you can set any class using the class parameter or by setting the fplformatopt array request 1 with pagelist other parameters request 1 you can override most pagelist parameters by providing request parameters in the url for example pagelist order name request 1 will normally sort the list by name but if the page s url contains order time the list will be sorted by time if the url contains order the list will be unordered note in the url encode any s that are in your parameters as 23 since this parameter gives users who don t have edit rights the ability to run a pagelist of their choosing consider its security implications for your website before using it since version 2 2 71 it is possible to explicitely allow only certain parameters that can be overridden or to disallow some parameters to be overridden if you need this instead of 1 enter the parameter names allow all parameters to be overridden pagelist request 1 allow only order and count parameters to be overridden pagelist request order count allow all parameters to be

condition for example pagelist if date ftime gw v name name returns all of the pages where the name is in the same week as that of the current page if any arguments within the quotes could contain a space they must be quoted pagelist if date 2009 01 01 2009 12 31 mydate order the order option allows the pages in the list to be sorted according to different criteria use a minus sign to indicate a reverse sort multiple sorting criteria can be specified using a comma and you can create your own custom pagelist sort order order name alphabetically by name default order order name alphabetically by name across groups order title alphabetically by title rather than names order time most recently changed pages last order ctime time of page creation see note order group title by multiple criteria in this instance sort by title within groups order random shuffle the pages into random sequence order pagetextvarname alphabetically by page text variable value note no braces order pagevarname alphabetically by page variable value note no braces also the order option allows custom ordering functions to be written note trail preserves the order of the pages as they appear on the trail unless you ve specified order explicitly or there is a default order in the page list template so pmwiki s alphabetical default order does not apply when trail is specified note ctime was added to pages only from pmwiki 2 1 beta15 onwards pages created by earlier versions don t carry a ctime attribute and can t be sorted that way cache 0 pagelist has the capability to cache lists which greatly speeds up processing when pagelistcachedir is set every once in a while this caching can result in undesired results specifying cache 0 disables caching specifying variables as parameters you

input text of a searchbox or to the markup or both input text box parameters can be added to the searchbox markup an initial search string can be specified in the searchbox markup but it must be in the form value search string that search string is displayed in the input text and can be modified by when the search is run an optional placeholder value can be specified in the form placeholder search in recent browsers this value appears gray in the search field when it is empty note this attribute is valid html5 but if you use it in a html4 skin your page will not validate the size of the text input field can be specified with the size parameter where size 40 would specify the current default value tip if more than one searchbox appears on a page adding a blank initial value like this value to the markup for each searchbox will prevent a search string for one box from populating all of the other boxes the target page for displaying searchbox results can be set with the parameter target groupname pagename the default is the current page the entire searchbox form can be overridden by defining the searchboxfmt variable in one s configuration file if searchboxfmt is defined then the parameters to searchbox are ignored and the content of the searchboxfmt variable are used instead the additional parameter label label can be used to change the label of the associated submit

sli pmwiki othervariables classes group research publications code login pmwiki othervariables link variables variables pagelist variables fmtv this variable is an array that is used for string substitutions at the end of a call to fmtpagename for each element in the array the key interpreted as a string will be replaced by the corresponding value the variable is intended to be a place to store substitution variables that have frequently changing values thus avoiding a rebuild of the variable cache making fmtpagename faster also see fmtp values of fmtv are set by the internal functions formattablerow linkimap handlebrowse previewpage handleedit pmwikiauth and passwdvar apparently to set values for system generated string substitutions like pagetext fmtp this variable is an array that is used for pattern substitutions near the beginning of a call to fmtpagename for each element in the array the key interpreted as a pattern will be replaced by the corresponding value evaluated for the name of the current page this is for instance used to handle substitutions that depend on the pagename passed to fmtpagename also see fmtv from robots php if enablerobotcloakactions is set then a pattern is added to fmtp to hide any action url parameters in page urls generated by pmwiki for actions that robots aren t allowed to access this can greatly reduce the load on the server by not providing the robot with links to pages that it will be forbidden to index anyway fmtpv this variable is an array that is used for defining page variables new variables can be defined with fmtpv varname variable definition which can be used in markup with varname please note that the contents of fmtpv varname are eval ed to produce the final text for varname so the contents must be a php expression which is valid at the time of substitution in particular this does not work this doesn t work fmtpv mytext this is my text warning doesn t work the problem is that the text this is my text is not a valid php expression to work it would need to be placed in quotes so that what actually gets stored in fmtpv mytext is this is my text which is a valid php expression for a text string thus the correct way to do this would be with an extra set of quotes this will work fmtpv mytext this is my text this also has implications for how internal php or pmwiki variables are accessed to have the page variable myvar produce the contents of the internal variable myvar many folks try the following which does not work this doesn t work either myvar somecomplexfunction fmtpv myvar myvar warning doesn t work there are several correct ways to do this depending on whether you need the value of the myvar variable as it was at the time the fmtpv entry was created or at the time that a particular instance of myvar is being rendered on a page for most simple page variables that don t change during the processing of a page its more efficient to set the value when the entry is created myvar somecomplexfunction fmtpv myvar myvar capture contents of myvar note if myvar should contain single quotes the above won t work as is and you ll need to process the variable to escape any internal quotes for more complex cases where an internal variable may have different values at different places in the page possibly due to the effects of other markup then you need to make the fmtpv entry make an explicit reference to the global value of the variable and the variable had better be global like this global myvar fmtpv myvar globals myvar finally there s nothing to stop you from simply having the evaluation of the fmtpv entry execute a function to determine the replacement text add page variable today formats today s date as yyyy mm dd fmtpv today strftime y m d time once again please note that the values of the elements of fmtpv are eval ed so always sanitize any user input the following is very insecure fmtpv var request var critically insecure allows php code injection fmtpv var addslashes request var critically insecure allows php code injection see the recipe cookbook httpvariables for a better way to use these variables see cookbook morecustompagevariables for more examples of how to use fmtpv maxpagetextvars this variable prevents endless loops in accidental recursive pagetextvariables which could lock down a server default is 500 which means that each pagetextvariable from one page can be displayed up to 500 times in one wiki page if you need to display it more than 500 times set in config php something like maxpagetextvars 10000 ten thousand times pagecachedir enables the cache of most of the html for pages with no conditionals the variable contains the name of a writable directory where pmwiki can cache the html output to speed up subsequent

sli pmwiki notify classes group research publications code login pmwiki notify blocklist documentation index passwords administration blocklist variables basic variables administrators basic the notify php script allows a site administrator to configure pmwiki to send email messages whenever pages are changed on the wiki site notifications can be configured so that multiple page changes over a short period of time are combined into a single email message to avoid flooding mailboxes this feature is useful for sites and pages that have infrequent updates as it eliminates the need to frequently check recentchanges pages just to see if anything has changed in order for notifications to work the notify php script must be enabled in the site s local customization usually this is as simple as placing the following in local config php enablenotify 1 notification configuration once enabled the notification system gets its configuration from the siteadmin notifylist wiki page the siteadmin notifylist page contains entries of the form notify alice example com this says that information about page changes should be periodically emailed to alice example com the siteadmin notifylist page can contain multiple notify lines to cause notifications to be sent to multiple addresses the notify lines can be concealed by placing them inside of an if false conditional section on the page note do not put any spaces around the equal sign notifications will fail silently if you have this is a really easy mistake to make because all of the other assignments have spaces around the equal sign notify fred example com rather than notify fred example com notification options the basic syntax is notify email address name abc group def trail ghi squelch 123 delay 123 a number of options exist for limiting the pages that result in a notification the group and name parameters can be used to restrict notifications to specific pages or groups send notifications about the main group to alice example com notify alice example com group main notify bob example com of any changes to the home page notify bob example com name main homepage notify charles example com of changes to pages except in main notify charles example com group main note the options are similar to the pagelist syntax for maintaining arbitrary lists of pages i e watchlists it s generally easier to build a trail of pages to be watched the following entry in siteadmin notifylist will send alice example com an email containing changes to any of the pages listed in the profiles alice trail notify alice of changes to pages listed in profiles alice notify alice example com trail profiles alice note that once this entry has been added to siteadmin notifylist alice can easily change her watchlist by editing the profiles alice page and doesn t need to edit the siteadmin notifylist page in particular this means that an administrator can restrict editing of siteadmin notifylist yet allow individuals to maintain custom watchlists in other pages limitations of this feature only manually added links on a trail will be acknowledged by the notify list no group or other pagelist syntax nor any group recentchanges links will generate notifications using an include directive on the page siteadmin notifylist is not an operational work around pagetextvariables are not resolved you can t get the notification mail address from the profile page this is probably a good place to point out that edit access to siteadmin notifylist should be controlled otherwise malicious persons can use the notification capability to flood others electronic mailboxes by default siteadmin notifylist is blocked against reading or edits except by the admin as is the case for most pages in the siteadmin group adding notification entries via local customizations notification entries can also be added via the notifylist array in local config php simply add a line like the following enablenotify 1 notifylist notify alice example com group main notifylist notify bob example com name main homepage controlling notification frequency to prevent flooding of recipients mailboxes the notify script uses a squelch value as the minimum amount of time that must elapse between messages sent to any given email address the default squelch setting is 10800 seconds three hours which means that once a recipient address is sent a notification message it will not receive another for at least three hours any edits that occur during the squelch interval are queued for the next notification message the site administrator can change the default squelch interval via the notifysquelch parameter enable notifications enablenotify 1 notifysquelch 86400 wait at least one day in seconds between notifications in addition individual addresses can specify a custom squelch parameter in the siteadmin notifylist page alice receives at most one email per day notify alice example com squelch 86400 bob can get notifications hourly notify bob example com trail profiles bob squelch 3600 charles uses the site default squelch notify charles example com controlling notification delay because a page will often receive several edits in rapid succession e g a long post followed by several minor edits a site administrator can also set a notifydelay value that specifies how long to wait after an initial post before sending notifications enable notifications enablenotify 1 notifysquelch 86400 wait at least one day between notifications notifydelay 300 wait five minutes after initial post note that the squelch and delay values are minimums notifications are sent on the first execution of pmwiki after the delay period has expired for inactive sites this could be much longer than the specified delay periods this isn t really considered an issue since timely notifications are less important on relatively inactive sites however changes within the squelch time after the last notification will remain unnoticed if the wiki is not even visited for a long period after if this matters it might be necessary to make the server call pmwiki php regularly e g cron job custom delay parameters cannot be specified for individual addresses in the siteadmin notifylist page the delay parameter will be ignored notify edgar example com trail profiles edgar delay 600 note for windows installations sites running php under windows may not have php s mail function configured correctly such sites may need to add a line like ini set smtp smtp server com to config php where smtp server

sli pmwiki mailposts classes group research publications code login pmwiki mailposts administrators basic pmwiki variables as of pmwiki 2 1 7 the mailposts capability is being superceded by the more advanced notify php script see notify for details the mailposts php script allows a site administrator to configure pmwiki to send email messages whenever pages are changed on the wiki site mailposts can be configured so that multiple page changes over a short period of time are combined into a single email message to avoid flooding a mailbox the mailposts feature is especially useful for sites that have infrequent updates eliminating the need to frequently check recentchanges pages just to see if anything has changed full configuration details are available in scripts mailposts php below is a brief synopsis of what needs to go in config php or a per group customization script for mailposts php if defined pmwiki exit enablemailposts 1 to enable mailposts mailpoststo somebody example com where to send mail mailpostsdelay 1800 wait 30 min after initial post mailpostssquelch 7200 require 2 hours between mails note that mailpoststo may be a comma separated list of addresses if multiple recipients are desired for newbies the only file that needs editing is the local config php for this recipe to work add any or all of the configurations to the config php file and it should work rather easily assuming your host meets the other requirements on a per group basis you could set local mygroup php create the mygroup php file if necessary to php if defined pmwiki exit enablemailposts 1 enable mailposts mailpoststo xxx mail1 com yyy mail2 com where to send mail mailpostsfrom bbb mail4 com mailpostsdelay 1800 wait 30 minutes after initial post mailpostssquelch 7200

workdir group mailposts now make a change or add a document to one of the mygroup documents and save it you should receive an email be patient even if you set my test settings mailpostsdelay 18 wait 18 seconds after initial post mailpostssquelch 72 wait 72 seconds after initial post it took between 5 and 10 minutes for me to get the email since an initial post is often followed by several posts containing minor edits it s useful to wait a short period of time before sending an email mailpostsdelay is the minimum amount of time that must elapse from an initial post before a message is sent a delay of zero means to immediately send a message whenever an update is received any additional posts occuring during the delay period are included in the message when it is sent the message is sent on the first execution of pmwiki php after the delay period has expired which for inactive sites could be much longer than the delay period pmwiki php calls mailposts php so if no one visits the section that calls mailposts php the email will be delayed for clarification and an example using per group settings the mailpostsdelay is set to 1800 1 2 hour in mygroup and the person editing mygroup finishes in less than 1 2 hour and leaves mygroup no one visits mygroup again for two days the email message indicating that the editing of mygroup has taken place will not be sent for two days this will not be a problem as site or group activity increases mailpostssquelch specifies the minimum amount of time that must elapse before sending another notification message this is useful to prevent large number of rapid succession messages if mailpostsdelay is set to a small value the defaults for mailpostsdelay and mailpostssquelch are 0 and 7200 with these values an email is sent as soon as a page is changed and subsequent changes are held for at least two hours before being sent in another message the variables used to control mailposts are given below and also described in the mailposts php script note for windows installations sites running php under windows may not have php s mail function configured correctly such sites may need to add a line like ini set smtp smtp

sli pmwiki localcustomizations classes group research publications code login pmwiki localcustomizations internationalizations documentation index group customizations a wiki administrator can make a lot of customizations simply by setting variables in the local config php and defining cascading style sheets in pub css local css files any group or page can also have its own configuration file and configuration css file this page describes how customizations work in general see pmwiki documentation index for specific customizations that are commonly performed at many pmwiki installations including skins change the look and feel of part or all of pmwiki internationalizations language internationalisation of web pages custom markup using the markup function for custom wiki syntax migration to php 5 5 intermaps interwiki links definition and use local config php from its inception pmwiki has been designed so that wiki administrators can greatly customize the way pmwiki displays pages and the markup sequences used to generate pages this is even mentioned explicitly in pmwiki philosophy 4 collaborative maintenance as a result the core pmwiki php script makes extensive use of pmwiki variables to determine how markup sequences will be processed and what each individual page will output the simplest type of customization is merely setting a variable to 1 or true here s an example that enables action diag and action phpinfo actions enablediag 1 you can begin a line with a an octothorpe a k a a hash symbol or pound sign to add a comment additionally some built in pmwiki variables take values other than 1 or 0 true or false here s another example that customizes the wiki s behavior with respect to search engine web robots see cookbook controllingwebrobots remove the default rel nofollow attribute for external links urllinkfmt a class urllink href linkurl title linkalt linktext a the scripts subdirectory below the directory holding the pmwiki php script has many customizations the pmwiki cookbook contains many example customizations recipes that you can download into the cookbook subdirectory the first few lines of each of these scripts generally contain instructions about how to enable and use the feature provided by the script these customizations are included in your config php site configuration for most scripts this is done by simply adding lines like include once cookbook recipefile php and include once scripts scriptfile php at the end of the config php file to enable them some of the scripts are automatically enabled for you via the scripts stdconfig php script unless you disable it by setting enablestdconfig 0 in local config php order of the commands in config php link the following order is recommended define scripturl and pubdirurl if needed define any custom pagestore class like sqlite compressedpagestore or pergroupsubdirectories next include once scripts xlpage utf 8 php next call xlpage which needs the definitive rw wikidir already set in order to find the wiki page containing the translations next include authuser php if needed because pmwiki caches some group and page authorization levels when a page is accessed next include any other scripts and recipes any direct function call in config php like resolvepagename condauth pagetextvar pagevar retrieveauthpage or others if possible should be done near the end of config php note each part is not required but if your wiki needs it this is the recommended order in config php character encoding of config php the encoding used when you save config php has an effect your text editor should allow you to save config php in the encoding of your wiki the default encoding of pmwiki is iso 8859 1 for new wikis it is recommended to enable utf 8 newer operating systems like gnu linux freebsd and apple generally default to saving text files in unicode utf 8 in windows the default encoding is ansi windows 1252 which is almost the same as pmwiki s iso 8859 1 the following free libre software text editors can edit and save a file in different encodings cross platform kate for kde geany arachnophilia scite bluefish vim and others windows notepad context notepad 2 os x aquamacs note that if you use the utf 8 encoding you should save your files without byte order mark bom over time pmwiki will be updated to default to unicode utf 8 encoding which allows all possible alphabets and languages see utf 8 for more information pub css local css you can create this file and set there some custom css styles which will override any styles set by skins for example h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 color 880000 dark red titles a text decoration none don t underline links don t modify pmwiki php or other core files you should strongly resist the temptation to directly modify the pmwiki php script or the files in the scripts subdirectory any modifications you make to these files will probably be overwritten whenever you upgrade instead look at some of the sample scripts for examples of customizations that can be performed from config php you can even create your own script to do a customization and use include once to include it from config php if you do make your own customization script you can safely put it in the cookbook subdirectory it won t get overwritten by an upgrade there you might also want to submit your customization to the pmwiki users mailing list or the cookbook so that others can benefit from your effort and so that it can perhaps be included in future releases of pmwiki faq there s no config php it s not even clear what a local customisation file is the sample config php file in the docs folder is given as an example copy it to the local folder and rename it to config php you can then remove the symbols or add other commands shown in the documentation see also group customizations can i change the default page something other than main homepage defaultpage yes just set the defaultpage variable to the name of the page you want to be the default you might also look at the defaultgroup and defaultname configuration variables defaultpage abc startpage note the recommendations in defaultname and the need to set pagepathfmt

newer get the group and page name pagename resolvepagename pagename page pagevar pagename fullname group pagevar pagename group name pagevar pagename name note the importance of the order of customizations in config php above to avoid caching problems if you need the verbatim group and page name from the request early in config php pagename is guaranteed to be set to any value of n if it s set or any value of pagename if it s set or the path info information from request uri whatever follows script name or blank otherwise according to this posting can i remove items from the wikilib d

sli pmwiki links classes group research publications code login pmwiki links creating new pages documentation index images authors basic a key feature of wiki based systems is the ease of creating hyperlinks or short links in the text of a document pmwiki provides multiple mechanisms for creating such links links to other pages in the wiki to create an internal link to another page simply enclose the name of the page inside double square brackets as in wiki sandbox or installation this results in links to wiki sandbox and installation respectively pmwiki creates a link by using the text inside the double brackets it does this by removing spaces between the words and automatically capitalizing the first letter of each word following spaces or other punctuation like thus wiki sandbox wiki sandbox and wikisandbox all display differently but create the same link to the page titled wikisandbox or in other words pmwiki will automatically create the link path name using the page name in camelcase but the link text will display in the format you have entered it some pmwiki sites default not will recognize words written in camelcase called a wikiword automatically as a link to a page of the same name links with different link text there are three ways to get a different link text hide link text link text within parentheses will not be not displayed so that wiki sandbox links to wikisandbox but displays as sandbox for addresses actually containing parentheses use 28 and 29 http www example com linkwith 28parenthese 29 change link text you can specify another link text after a vertical brace as in wikisandbox a play area or you can use an arrow to reverse the order of the link text and the target as in a play area wikisandbox both links displays as a play area show page title instead of page name the use of special characters in the page name is not a problem for pmwiki but on some servers it may be better to use only plain a z letters for the page name which is also a filename and set the page title to the extended or international characters with the title pagetitle directive within the page the page title can be shown instead of the page name with the pagename link markup e g page basicediting contains the directive title basic pmwiki editing rules with the result that a link written as basicediting will display as basic pmwiki editing rules see also enablelinkplustitlespaced since pmwiki version 2 2 14 this works also for those technical pages that have an entry in the xlpage without the need to add the title pagetitlename directive within that page for more details see localization localization on top of above ways a suffix can be added to the end of a link which becomes part of the link text but not of the target page name note this feature works with the pagename markup only since version 2 2 90 what to type what it looks like wiki sandbox wiki sandbox es wikisandbox wiki sandbox wikisandbox wiki sandbox es basicediting sandbox sandboxes wiki sandbox wiki sandboxes basic pmwiki editing rules links with tool tip from version 2 2 14 pmwiki can show tooltip titles with the following format external link http pmwiki org external tool tip title external link eg external link or http pmwiki org internal link links internal tool tip title internal link eg internal link or links anchor links name anchor tool tip title anchor link text since version 2 2 48 eg anchor link text or name intermap link wikipedia wiki tool tip title intermap link eg intermap link or wikipedia wiki links to nonexistent pages links to nonexistent pages are displayed specially to invite others to create the page see creating new pages to learn more links to pages in other wiki groups links as written above are links between pages of the same group to create a link to a page in another group add the name of that other group together with a dot or slash as prefix to the page name for example links to main wikisandbox could be written as what to type what it looks like main wikisandbox main wikisandbox main wiki sandbox main wikisandbox link text main wikisandbox main wikisandbox wikisandbox sandbox link text wikisandbox to link to the default home page of a group the name of the page can be omitted main main main main see wiki group to learn more about pmwiki groups category links categories are a way to organize and find related pages the idea is that every page that falls into a particular subject area should have a link to a shared page containing links to other pages on that subject these shared pages are created in the special group category and thus these subject areas are called categories adding a page to the category subject is simple by adding the subject markup somewhere on that page this will create a link to the page category subject so subject is a kind of link shortcut to the page category subject see categories to learn more user page links similar is author a link shortcut to the page author in the special group profiles pmwiki automatically creates this type of link for the current author when it encounters three tilde characters in a row in the page text the current author is the name found in the author field when you create or modify a page the current date and time is appended when four tilde characters in a row are encountered so when the author field contains author markup will be replaced by author markup will be replaced by author october 10 2010 at 04 50 pm link shortcuts pagename creates a reference link as shown below 1 links to specific locations within a page anchors to define a location or bookmark within a page to which you may jump directly use the markup name this creates an anchor that uniquely identifies that location in the page then to have a link jump directly to that anchor use one of name link text within the same page or pagename name or pagename name link text for a location on another page the form pagename name may be useful for hiding the anchor text in a link for example here s a link to the intermaps section below notes the anchor itself must begin with a letter not a number valid characters in the anchor are letters digits dash underscore and the period a link to an anchor must have the same capitalization as the anchor itself spaces are not allowed in an anchor my anchor won t work myanchor will all anchor names
