glassdoor s list of the 50 best jobs in american for 2020 which shouldn t be too surprising given the rise of big data and growing demand for empirical based decision making across many industries to help meet this demand the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics is currently accepting applications for the new master of data science mds program it is launching in the fall of 2021 anyone interested in joining the inaugural cohort of this 15 month professional graduate program can apply online the early application deadline is december 15th 2020 after that applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until april 15th 2021 we see lots of demand coming from individuals who were trained in computer science for example without rigorous statistical training says daniel gillen chair of the department of statistics we also see demand coming from individuals who were trained in mathematical sciences and statistics but don t have the computing background he continues and then there are a lot of individuals coming from other disciplines as well from business analytics backgrounds and from political and social science backgrounds so whether you re in the tech industry at a financial institution in a domain such as education or healthcare or a recent graduate looking for more training this program is designed to advance your data science skills while there are minimum course requirements the goal is to fill certain gaps in training while providing practical hands on experience what makes this program unique is that it is going to be taught and delivered by world renowned experts in the foundations of data science meaning both statistics and computing says gillen the courses will cover applied probability and mathematical statistics statistical modeling and computing machine learning data management and visualization and artificial intelligence more importantly they will be evenly split between faculty from the department of statistics and the department of computer science both of which are housed in the school of ics industry is learning very quickly that a lot of people can scrape and analyze data but to do something truly meaningful with data to make decisions that will drive the industry forward you really have to have a basic foundational understanding of the methods you re using says gillen that is what drives the philosophy of this degree the program spans five quarters with the first three quarters comprising coursework in both statistics and computer science the summer quarter is available for internships or additional courses to accommodate working professionals all courses will be offered in the late afternoon or evening and for those in need of financial assistance scholarships and financial aid are available the final quarter is the capstone course where students will work on industry derived projects gaining real world hands on experience we plan to partner with businesses to help generate not only contacts for students but also interesting capstone projects if your business is interested in sponsoring a capstone project please contact bryan munoz at mds ics uci edu furthermore because this program adds to the list of successful professional programs already offered through the school of ics students will have access to dedicated career counselors and will participate in showcase events so while the goal is to keep the initial mds cohort relatively small students will be able to leverage resources and events available through the established graduate programs it will be fairly selective so we re aiming at 50 students for the first cohort says gillen though that might grow in future years this select group of students will gain experience in using relevant data related software and technologies so they can thrive as data scientists whether their goal is to work in the tech industry or government or anywhere in between we re going to focus on taking what is learned about the foundations of these disciplines stresses gillen and applying them to real world data shani murray a campus gem uci s statistical consulting servicesa look at health and technology trends for 2021 and

statistics current course listings news seminars news seminar center for statistical consulting a look at health and technology trends for 2021 and beyond january 15 2021 the fields of computer science informatics and statistics have been influencing healthcare for decades and 2020 served as an important reminder of the critical role both healthcare and technology play in people s daily lives the covid 19 pandemic put a spotlight on healthcare while stay at home orders significantly boosted technology use in general and telehealth practices in particular looking to the new year ahead how might the connections between technology and health become further entwined and how will this impact the future of healthcare here to address these questions are three professors from the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics yunan chen associate professor of informatics whose research focuses on human computer interaction hci computer supported cooperative work cscw and health informatics nikil dutt distinguished professor of computer science who studies embedded systems healthcare iot computer aided design and brain inspired architectures and computing and bin nan professor of statistics who works to improve human health through the development of statistical and machine learning methods professors chen dutt and nan each discuss new opportunities and challenges as advances in technology lead to fundamental shifts in the healthcare industry how is your field influencing the healthcare industry and what changes do you expect to see in the next few decades yunan chen chen informatics has had a huge influence on the healthcare industry the medical field is centered on the use of information in fact the field of medical informatics was established to meet the growing demand to collect access and use health data and information in the past five to 10 years health it systems have almost completely transformed paper based medical practices into electronic health records as everything becomes digitalized huge amounts of information and data can be collected and shared across practices opening the door to new clinical research and health policies another major influence stems from the digitalization of our everyday life with advances in consumer facing health it applications individuals can now collect manage and use personal health data that was not available in the past this information can then be shared with clinicians to benefit their practices across different settings clinical home or communities informatics research and applications are helping people better access information gather data and engage in evidence based practices leading to improved public health nikil dutt dutt one big shift we re seeing is this notion of digital health the idea of using technology for better self care it s this whole idea that even the field of medicine is recognizing called p4 health which is predictive preventive personalized and participatory health instead of the traditional model of episodic healthcare where you go to the doctor or er when you re sick we re moving toward proactively shifting the emphasis to earlier phases in terms of lifestyle digital health technologies including computer science informatics and statistics are the key enablers moving us in that direction we ve always talked about personalized health but now technology lets us use data and statistics to build models of individuals that can improve the quality of healthcare by delivering services in a more targeted fashion another tremendous shift we have seen just this past year is the move to remote healthcare and telehealth covid 19 accelerated the move to delivering services using technology the other thing that we ll be soon talking about is integrating mental and physical health far too often physical and mental care are siloed and services are provided in a completely uncoordinated fashion so i see a big change with personalization and this ability to integrate all of that information in a manner that can help healthcare professionals better do their jobs and more importantly help individuals empower themselves to make decisions in an informed manner bin nan nan statistics plays a very important role in any health related research the field of so called biostatistics is evidence of that where the emphasis is on health and medical research i can name many interesting influential topics such as survival analysis and longitudinal data analysis in the past two decades technology has evolved so that people can perform fine sequencing of dna information there are also many impacts along the lines of imaging especially in neuroscience research the brain is a very interesting organ that you usually cannot access so you can t directly measure brain activity you have to rely on imaging in both areas massive data are generated and that motivates some interesting statistical research in a fast growing area called high dimensional statistics in the coming years people will increasingly use wearable devices to track data including activity data and heartbeat and temperature measurements this presents statistical challenges in terms of how you analyze the data and how you design interventions to improve human health such as a message that says you should exercise more or you need to relax i m part of uci s new institute for future health ifh led by ramesh jain and the focus is on trying to understand how we collect and use mobile device data to improve health this will be a very interesting field that s depending on technology involvement as wearable devices with well designed apps become more and more available to people so we call this the big data era new statistical methods are being developed and some of them will become much more impactful in these scientific areas which will certainly reshape scientific knowledge in the future what about covid 19 s influence how did the global pandemic impact your research chen covid is not only a global public health crisis but also an information crisis our past research in this area shows that during a public health crisis information is often uncertain and ambiguous challenging how people perceive personal risks and make decisions it is crucial for informatics researchers like us to examine the use of information and technologies during this challenging time i ve been doing a multicultural study on contact tracing technologies for covid 19 in the u s korea and japan working with informatics professor daniel epstein and a group of international collaborators we started looking at human tracers and technology tracers and under different conditions when people prefer humans versus technology one of our findings to be presented at chi 21 is that when people have to report their symptoms during a 14 day quarantine they prefer technology check ins but when being notified of a covid positive diagnosis or of exposure to the virus people prefer to talk to a human so they can ask questions and receive emotional assurance right now we re doing a similar study in korea and also a survey in japan as they recently rolled out their national covid tracing system i ve also worked on a collaborative project looking into people s risk perceptions during the pandemic and how those perceptions might change as the pandemic wears on again findings to be presented at chi 21 in another study we looked into the beliefs of those who oppose facial masks we used a combination of machine learning and qualitative content analysis methods to analyze twitter data from january to october 2020 this study reveals the temporal trend of public opinions and the reasons why some people do not support mask wearing helping us understand public concerns and learn how to better communicate health policies to the public dutt one of the big projects i m working on is called unite underserved communities which provides services so that underserved pregnant women can take better care of themselves the project uses what we call a community health worker model where a community health worker traditionally goes in and visits with the mom periodically what we were looking at is how wearable technology can provide ubiquitous continuous monitoring that closes the loop by augmenting what happens during the physical visits we re doing the pilot study now so covid actually allowed us to test this intervention which became even more important when health workers could no longer visit the women at their homes so i think that provided us with an opportunity to test it and show that digital services can help people in this instance pregnant moms take better care of themselves also together with psychology professor jesse borelli we were looking at stress management of college kids we started this before covid recruiting between 10 to 30 students for each cohort using a combination of physiological monitoring with wearables and ecological momentary assessment ema questionnaires delivered on an app we combined the students physical health with their mental health state to evaluate and track their stress levels over time and provide feedback as covid hit we saw huge rises in stress levels it was extremely important to see what these kids were going through but it s also very exciting to use these digital technologies to build a personalized model nan covid did not interrupt my research too much since most of my research activities are now on zoom meanwhile i got a chance to work with professor jonathan watanabe from the uci school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences who is interested in how doctors treat covid 19 patients he was trying to understand the patterns of different medicine use over time among different patient categories the data set that we used was from the electronic health records another source of big data for health research of the uc system we have five medical schools and many many hospitals in the uc system and we have access to that data which is updated on a daily basis about what medicines were prescribed to the patients this is observational and descriptive not a clinical evaluation but it s very interesting work covid 19 has also highlighted racial disparities in healthcare what role do you think racial justice plays in healthcare and technology chen it definitely plays a huge role there have been recent studies outside of the healthcare world about how if the training data of ai systems does not include a certain population then the algorithms developed based on such data might lead to potential bias in the healthcare field i could imagine such scenarios in future ai assistant practices if the systems don t have enough training data for underrepresented populations or economically disadvantaged communities that could lead to serious consequences since we don t have universal healthcare in the u s it s really hard for some people to afford certain treatments for example infertility treatments if a technology is developed based on patient data with participation only by people who can afford it then bias can be embedded into the design i ve also seen studies looking into how technology can help clinicians avoid implicit bias when treating patients if they subconsciously describe things differently to different patients or maybe use a different tone or style of interaction if we look at the future of the entire healthcare industry and insurance more broadly there have been some articles about how if you are inherently prone to develop some kind of disease based on your medical history we would have different kinds of insurance that s one of the ethical issues we discuss in my medical informatics class with more algorithms and decision support being deployed in the healthcare field we need to be careful to not widen health disparity or inequity through technology design dutt that s so important we have a planning grant with nursing colleagues professor amir rahmani and dean adey nyamathi for a new nsf program called the future of work our grant digital health for future of community centered care is looking at community centered care because we all know that a large part of the cost of healthcare comes from training doctors and nurses but if you look at underserved populations community workers are the ones who actually interface with people and then report back to nurses or doctors so we feel that technology can empower and grow these types of services to help underserved communities especially in this climate so you asked what role does racial justice play and i m kind of turning that around saying technology has a tremendous role to play in providing services for the most underserved communities an example is the work we re doing through unite with moms orange county but i think we can take that kind of model and scale it i ll give you two instances that we ve discussed one is looking at mechanisms to help deliver services to the homeless community and another one is the meals on wheels program which delivers food to typically underserved elderly populations and these individuals are not only underserved but also might be going through life changes where they may be having early onset of dementia or they might not be taking care of themselves so how can we use technology to help identify problems early and communicate and address that nan in healthcare we see racial discrepancies all the time for example i was involved in a project looking at medicare data for end stage renal disease patients usually the standard treatment is dialysis for this cms centers for medicare medicaid services project we developed measures to evaluate the performance of dialysis facilities one of the issues we often see is racial discrepancy it s always there sometimes disparities can be explained biologically different genetic makeup for example but many are actually due to the social economic status how to address that is the billion dollar question people of color have disadvantages in terms of access to quality healthcare which directly impacts their health status there s a big debate about universal healthcare but i think that in a rich country like the u s everyone should have a certain level of care what other major challenges do we as a society need to address in the next five years chen now that we are able to collect a large amount of personal health data both by healthcare professionals and consumers the major challenge we face is how to better utilize such data to meet the diverse needs of stakeholders we often hear clinicians complaining about not having enough time to review the data patient brought to the clinic or patients being confused or distressed by their own health data there are structured constraints in our healthcare system that do not allocate physicians enough time to perform the data work brought on by new technologies on the consumer side users might not have sufficient knowledge skills and literacy to manage their own data and health how do we design health it systems that both provide data access as well as allow appropriate use of such data avoiding unintended negative consequences so beyond the technical aspect the human and social aspects of design are even more important how do you visualize and present the data to different stakeholders sometimes the systems also generate suggestions or predictions you might get diabetes if you continue leading this kind of lifestyle or if a prediction says you won t get pregnant in the next five days do you trust it and who is taking responsibility for the consequences we need to design technologies to not only collect data but also present it in a way that makes sense and that addresses diverse users data needs and to let users understand their data instead of over trusting it we did a fertility technology study and found the technology implicitly placed both physical and emotional burden on individuals trying to conceive many apps were following social norms making the women not their partners track the data but is that really the right way to do it so that s part of the challenge we need more experts who can connect both the technical side and the medical health side to create better healthcare technologies dutt one of the biggest challenges is finding how we move from episodic event based medical care to a model that s more integrated holistic and proactive this requires us to personalize the model to the individual spanning not only biomarkers to show if you re at risk for say heart disease but also the mental health aspect breaking down siloed healthcare to deliver integrated services will be critical this challenge transcends computer science and goes to the root of how policymakers and the government look at and fund healthcare in society if you look at how we re trying to achieve this vision of empowering people and developing personal models we can do that in smaller pilot studies but achieving it in practice is a huge challenge the other major barrier is privacy which varies not only from person to person but also very importantly as a person s health condition changes i m a healthy young adult and i m invincible so i don t want to share my data but you take an aging individual and there you get into all kinds of issues maybe in principle they don t want to share their health information but because of their condition they might need to maybe they re suffering from dementia it s a very complicated issue so how can we develop policies and infrastructures that can manage the privacy requirements of healthcare as the health state of an individual changes over time that s a very interesting aspect that colleagues here including professor sharad mehrotra have been working on nan again focusing on statistical research in health one of the greatest challenges in the next five years will be better understanding deep learning ai algorithms and being able to do some sort of reliable statistical inference on those models deep learning algorithms have been very successful in many areas of health research especially in radiology there are many interesting examples of the machine doing better than even the best trained radiologists when you have huge amounts of data you can train the algorithm to do more precise diagnoses but one challenge from the statistical side is trying to understand the effects of the predictors for example the risk factors to a disease statisticians build simple models that are easily interpretable but deep learning algorithms are usually a black box type of thing we don t really know what s going on inside the black box the algorithm can usually achieve a pretty good prediction but we still need to understand it more in order to find modifiable risk factors to improve people s health or to gain knowledge of disease mechanisms so we ll need statisticians and computer science researchers working together to open the black box finally what research will you be focused on in the coming year chen i m going to continue focusing on data driven technologies and examining the data work of individuals engaging in their everyday health practices we re doing a project on asthma with one of my ph d students imagine you have an inhaler that tracks your locations and notes where you take medications and senses certain environmental variables so how do individuals their caregivers and their healthcare providers benefit from such data and how can we design the right technologies to support their data work increasingly these data driven technologies are coupled with ai to provide algorithmic advice such as suggestions or predictions if the app tells you when and where you are more likely to have an asthma attack would you trust and follow such a prediction how do you make sure that the ai is accurate so i think on both the clinical and patient sides that s a really interesting direction i ll be working on including as it relates to smart health technology such as the smart diaper that tells you when it needs to be changed or the smart app that predicts your fertility window or tells you when to feed your baby increasingly society which is enthusiastic about data and ai is going to push for changes in how we manage our health and lifestyles so we need to make sure these technologies are designed properly dutt some exciting projects are in the works through the new institute for future health ifh we talked about unite and mental health and another area is food because what we eat can affect our mood and our physical health so a new line of research we ve started looking into together with professors ramesh jain and amir rahmani in the school of nursing relates to the new topic of food computing another ongoing effort is in pain assessment where we are trying to quantify the level of pain for subjects who are not able to communicate such as people just coming out of surgery or neonatal infants this will help doctors and nurses determine whether to administer pain medication and how much we re doing a small study with the uci medical center looking at some post operative patients to create a baseline and build a model using facial monitoring and measuring facial muscles and sweat and heart rate it s very exciting finally using data sets that we can access through the uc system we re doing covid detection intervention and prediction studies so it s quite a portfolio of projects and i am really excited that i m at uci it s a pleasure to wake up every morning and work with all these really bright people nan my personal research is on aging in general and alzheimer s disease in particular one of the problems i m thinking about is how to estimate alzheimer s disease prevalence a challenging issue is in survival analysis which is my field of interest the commonly used mathematical models implicitly assume that people can live forever you don t say people have to die before age 150 even though that s what we observe in the real world in fact that kind of modeling assumption is very hard to handle for aging studies which focus on the end of life so the idea i m proposing is to look at people who have already died to see who developed the disease during their lifetime and who didn t where the lifetimes are finite that s clearer information trying to understand during a lifetime who developed the disease when it happened and how it relates to certain risk factors it s natural to ask the question in a forward way how many people will get the disease in the next five years but my way of thinking is also going backwards looking at people s entire lifetimes to hopefully provide more precise estimation about this disease and a better evaluation of risk factors this is a new framework totally different from what people have been doing in the past and hopefully it will lead to important discoveries shani murray uci launches new professional program master of data scienceamstat news celebrating women in statistics 2021 annie qu

for the men s tournament the model sabin developed gave villanova a 50 1 chance to win the championship over north carolina people don t realize that 50 1 and 49 9 are essentially the same thing statistically they ve very similar explained sabin regardless the prediction running along the bottom of the espn channel had villanova with its 50 1 favored to win when you work in sports you start having these rooting interests that have nothing to do with anything rational admitted sabin who had no ties to either school and didn t really care who won yet based on his model espn had predicted a villanova win so he suddenly became very invested in that outcome i have never been more nervous than i was at this moment he replayed the moment he was referring to during the webinar transporting viewers to the final seconds of the 2016 championship just as north carolina tied the game well my model was very close 50 and the game is tied with five seconds left he recalled thinking at the time that s what the highest probability was this outcome but i also wanted people to not lose trust in me villanova then won the game with a buzzer beater basket the game had an incredible finish said sabin and the espn prediction had been correct there s more to the story including a statistical twist and lessons learned so if you re affiliated with uci be sure to watch the recording with your ucnet id during the webinar sabin also talked about how it was sports that really generated my love of statistics in the first place and he explained how using sports analogies helped him make sense of difficult concepts in college when he couldn t grasp the idea of n dimensional space he thought of it in terms of having five different variables and trying to predict the outcome of a game it s easier to understand concepts if applied to a passion like sports he said which he views as opportunity for introducing new students to statistics i m a big believer that using sports can help increase diversity in stem education guindani similarly views sports as a potential recruitment tool it s an area that provides opportunities for getting students excited about statistics leveraging sports webinars for recruitmentsabin s talk was one of a series of webinars offered by the sport statistics group recordings of the other webinars are available online with your ucnet id career paths in statistics with luke bornn co founder and chief scientist of zelus analytics recording data and statistics in baseball what it s like to work in a baseball analytics department with kevin ferris of the boston red sox and richard anderson of the cincinnati reds recording and watching sports through the eyes of a statistician with hal stern of the department of statistics recording as noted earlier the next webinar will feature brendan kent of draftkings and creator the measurables educational sports analytics and sports tech podcast while a ucnet id is required to view recordings of previous events the live webinars are open to anyone from high school students exploring potential majors and career options to professional sports analysts or even international statisticians visit the events page for log in information however the long term goal of these webinars is to help recruit a dedicated group of uci students interested in working on a variety of projects related to sports stats the hope is that students after watching a webinar will get involved with the sport statistics uci group any uci students can join the group all ics students are welcome as well as students who might be majoring in a different field e g economics or psychology says guindani it would be awesome to put together a group that could eventually collaborate with uci s athletics

capstone course in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics was in 2009 with 19 students from the department of informatics working on five project teams now more than a decade later the informatics capstone course is offered three times a year and ics has added undergraduate capstone courses for its computer science and data science majors it also offers capstone courses through its master of human computer interaction and design mhcid master of computer science mcs and master of software engineering mswe professional programs even with the global pandemic moving people out of classrooms and offices and into online spaces this past year more than 130 ics capstone projects were successfully completed tremendous growth we re growing in leaps and bounds says informatics professor hadar ziv who led that first capstone course so many years ago this growth was on full display at the ics spring 2021 capstone student design showcase where nine of the 12 projects presented were a mere sampling of the more than 60 projects completed for the undergraduate informatics computer science and data science capstone programs this year you can view many of the student capstone videos online it was hard to select projects for the showcase because they all were very competitive says professor sergio gago masague who led the new computer science capstone and its 16 projects after a successful pilot version last year the course has already grown from 50 to 70 students and gago masague plans to scale it up again next year the capstone required for the data science major the first such undergraduate degree program offered in the uc system resulted in 14 projects created by 42 students this year the course is co taught by two faculty members each year one from the computer science department and one from the statistics department the balanced and rigorous curriculum of the data science major allows students to take on a wide range of ambitious capstone projects ranging from predicting medical treatment effects using electronic health records to using time series techniques to forecast product demand stresses statistics professor vladimir minin who directed the data science program the last three years starting july 1 2021 statistics professor mine dogucu will take the helm of the program the other three projects presented at the capstone student design showcase were award winning designs from the butterworth design competition a software development competition open to ics students the top prize and 10 000 was awarded to the grasshopper fund a startup marketplace and funding platform ics has also witnessed growth at the graduate level with the mcs spring 2021 capstone showcase featuring 18 different projects one of which armory took third place in the butterworth design competition mcs students working on the armory interactive platform which lets developers experiment with various cybersecurity threats so they can proactively write secure code were awarded 3 500 this year another seven projects were completed for the mhcid program and a joint mcs and mswe winter showcase in december presented 46 projects ten of which were created by the inaugural mswe cohort of 34 students quantity and qualitythe growing number of projects isn t the only impressive element of the ics capstone program the quality of the projects is also increasing says jason king associate director of corporate relations in ics we re seeing more success stories on both the student and sponsor side as we refine the capstone process and devote more time up front to setting up the projects this benefits the students faculty and corporate sponsors we re not just doing projects to do projects he says we re ensuring students gain the hands on experience and soft skills needed for future success ziv agrees a couple of my teams were not only the best in their class but among the best i ve taught in 12 years or so he said referring to the adventure biofeedback project where students created a game environment to make speech therapy for kids fun and the dreams for schools project where students helped a nonprofit stem education program scale up its operations the game environment for the adventure biofeedback project in developing the speech therapy application computer software engineering major eduardo magdaleno said it was an opportunity for him to apply all of my culminated skills that i learned during my four years at uci he was able to practice agile development project management hci and more while working closely with the stakeholders i did demos and user testing and learned that talking and eliciting the right questions was very important so our application could be built with the users in mind informatics major stella adriana who helped design an instructor assignment sorter for dreams for schools similarly talked during the showcase about how the project helped her learn how to effectively communicate with developers google software engineer tim laubach one of more than 120 participants at the online capstone student design showcase stressed the importance of the students learning this lesson the most beautiful design in the world if it can t be implemented doesn t help the user gaining this practical hands one experience is what the capstone courses are all about there are things we just can t teach in a traditional classroom the capstone course gives students a leg up as they transition out of their undergraduate degree and into their careers says informatics lecturer matthew bietz who taught one of the capstone courses this year even those who already have a background in industry have a lot to gain from the capstone experience working on this project has expanded my knowledge of agile development and working on a team which will be significant in my career progression says mcs student uddeshya kumar who worked on an artistic photos application to help people create art from photos this project gave me the opportunity to learn new technologies that align with my professional goals and will prove to be crucial in the near future a presentation of the artistic photos application the project sponsors are yet another beneficiary of the capstone courses project sponsors tell me again and again how happy they are to have worked with the students says bietz some sponsors come from nonprofits and just this quarter our students built apps to help victims of trafficking to support parents of children with developmental disabilities and to help cancer patients better understand their treatment using 3d visualization to name just a few he says some sponsors join us from startups or larger tech companies and in addition to creating marketable products working with the students is a way to identify individuals they want to recruit this form of networking is invaluable to students and sponsors alike for all of the skill building and new knowledge the students get says bietz the real impacts of the capstone program lie in building relationships careers and passions if you are a company interested in sponsoring an undergraduate or

second ever virtual ceremony nevertheless represented something extraordinary the class of 2021 will have a unique place in our institutional memory as the most resilient and responsive class we have ever had the privilege of teaching said chancellor howard gillman during his opening remarks under the most extraordinary circumstances you rose to the occasion supported each other adapted and persisted as gillman lamented the physical separation of the occasion instead of the traditional gathering in the bren center he emphasized that no matter our physical circumstances we are right now anteaters together marking this great moment in your life graduates of the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics heard a similar sentiment from dean marios c papaefthymiou in his welcome for the ics ceremony ics expects to confer more than 1 200 undergraduate and 100 graduate degrees this year although the hybrid nature of this commencement is not as gratifying as an in person live ceremony the significance of the event remains as strong as ever said papaefthymiou as the class of 2021 transitioned from students to graduates joining a network of more than 10 000 ics alumni papaefthymiou spoke of their larger role in society our aspiration is that you re graduating from our program equipped to make a positive impact on our world using technology to do good and leading in creating a better future for everyone four student commencement speakers then recalled their anteater journeys starting with tiffany kong although kong has already secured a position as an engineer at qualcomm she admitted that she had no intention of graduating with a bachelor s degree in computer science when she first came to uci i never really thought about working in the tech or software industry let alone majoring in computer science but i did know three things i enjoyed math i enjoyed art and i really wanted to attend uci she told her fellow classmates through computer science i came to enjoy a variety of topics such as ai and hci because they provide a perfect blend between art and design and math and technology she spoke of both the devastation she felt after failing ics 32 as well as the courage she mustered to successfully retake the course for me failing a class seemed like a nightmare or even now for us graduating into a pandemic it s hard to get out of that doomsday mindset she said however this is what has made us stronger all these challenges that we have gone through have proven to us that we have never let doubt consume us similar to kong software engineering graduate jennifer kwon also found her passion at uci after taking a project management course my time at uci has brought me invaluable skills and i couldn t have asked for a better experience here she said she was driven to succeed taking courses over summer to continue her learning her senior capstone class provided one of her most memorable experiences as she conducted a research study in collaboration with the children s hospital of orange county to make speech therapy fun for kids the project was recently highlighted during the ics spring 2021 capstone student design showcase kwon had this advice for her classmates class of 2021 be fearless kind and optimistic anteaters computer science and engineering graduate ming hua lawrence spoke of the tremendous challenges he faced in his journey to this moment born with autism i m so grateful today to receive my bachelor s degree after studying for five and a half years he said noting that learning algorithms and programming c and systemverilog was especially difficult for him requiring more than twice the time needed for other students yet he persevered i truly feel that any goal is possible if we put our mind heart and soul into it he told his classmates my biggest wish today is to encourage you whether autistic or not to always have hope kindness and perseverance so the highest purpose can be reached first generation low income latino student francisco loya spoke of the resilience of this class of 2021 in particular a bird sitting in a tree is never afraid of the branch breaking because her trust is not in the branch but in her own wings said the computer science graduate the students who have gone through uci before us have passed tough classes met great people and graduated each and every one of us has done the same but have done so while assisting sick family members getting internships and job offers rescinded and fighting for equality he noted so yes we are now graduating with a degree but the strongest asset we ve proven that we have is grit and a strong work ethic the class of 2021 is indeed unique in having overcome the yearlong upheaval caused by the global pandemic each graduating student whose name was read with pomp and circumstance playing in the background as their slide flashed on the screen has their own story of overcoming challenges in earning their ics degree particularly during their final year in the program yet each and every one showed great determination in reaching this moment and will forever share a special place in history as that most resilient

machine learning it also serves as a great learning tool for uci students thanks to the second annual ml hackathon a student competition funded by the national science foundation the uci research community donated nine challenge datasets from the repository for the event and the research cyberinfrastructure center rcic provided the computational resources we wanted to create a fun opportunity for students to engage with real projects within the uci research community says tamanna hossain a graduate student in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics who organized this year s hackathon my favorite part of the event was definitely the enthusiasm and curiosity students brought to the table especially under the difficult conditions of the ongoing covid 19 pandemic ten teams participated in the virtual hackathon held may 14 through may 23 2021 and competed for the top prize of 500 for best overall and for four 250 prizes awarded for technical skills scientific insights creativity and best presentation yu miyauchi award winning hacksthe top prize went to hatomugi an ml model designed to detect fake reviews on yelp developed by data science major yu miyauchi the model leveraged the yelpnyc challenge dataset which contains 359 052 yelp reviews for restaurants in new york city miyauchi who graduated in june and is now a data analysis consultant at deloitte says this competition was a great way to simulate my future work yu miyauchi explaining his machine learning model for fake review detection in yelp qingchuan yang yihan wang another hack using the yelpnyc data was aces2alliance which won the technical skills award data science major yihan wang and computer science major qingchuan yang applied deep learning algorithms to predict whether an unlabeled yelp review was real or fake i was not expecting to win the award at the end says wang but i am grateful to ics for giving the current students a platform to showcase the skills we have learned yang added that it was exciting to apply ml theories learned from lectures to practice and see how powerful they are andrew chen the award for scientific insights went to i am a segmentation fault developed by computer science major andrew chen using the dataset containing climate change and ecosystem carbon information in california i created a regressor that predicts carbon densities in california based on projected temperature and precipitation conditions he says this event was a great opportunity to use the theoretical machine learning skills that we heard about in class on real world data sets richard lopez and rionel dmello the most creative hack was two truths and a lie developed by computer science majors rionel dmello and richard lopez given a misconception and tweet pair our goal was to detect if that tweet propagates the misconception allowing content moderation on social media the students used the covidlies dataset of approximately 6 000 tweet and misconception pairs and fasttext a shallow neural network to extract word embeddings i enjoyed working on a project that was so closely related to the pandemic and i understand the challenges that big tech faces in regard to reducing the spread of misinformation says dmello my partner and i also had to come up with innovative ways to communicate and share information over various platforms which was a challenge in itself lopez agrees working on a covid related project in the middle of the pandemic was quite an adventure randy huynh top left ruslan manahoran top right and william hou another hack using the covidlies dataset was wtawtaw which won the presentation award for this hack first year computer science students randy huynh and ruslan manahoran along with first year data science student william hou focused on characterizing common covid 19 misconceptions and developing a model to detect their presence covid 19 has had such a huge impact on our lives and all around the world and it was really interesting to explore how rampant covid 19 misinformation is on the internet says the teammates through our research we were able to determine commonalities between misinformative tweets such as word and phrase choice types of misinformation certain themes etc we hope our project will contribute to the development of more robust misinformation detection models in the future advancing ml researchin addition to the competition the event included ml research talks by computer science professor sameer singh and computer science ph d students sam showalter anthony chen dylan slack and gavin kerrigan singh chancellor s professor padhraic smyth and rcic director philip papadopoulos served as faculty mentors throughout the event and because all of the projects completed were open source the hackathon work contributed to ml research as well this is an amazing opportunity for undergraduates not only to gain hands on experience with applying machine learning to real problems which can really help them get jobs in machine learning but further working on scientific problems offered by uci faculty means that the undergraduates are helping advanced research i wish i had such

emerita jessica utts august 20 2021 this summer professor emerita jessica utts of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics was recognized with two prestigious awards highlighting her tremendous contributions related to the field of statistics george cobb lifetime achievement awardin june utts attended the 2021 u s conference on teaching statistics uscots as she participated in the online event she was unaware that a clock and tribute book were hidden behind a chair in her home office she learned of the items only after the consortium for the advancement of undergraduate statistics education cause announced her as the recipient of the 2021 george cobb lifetime achievement award in statistics education the award is presented biennially at uscots to an individual who has made lasting contributions with a broad impact and as outlined in her nomination letter jessica s work in the statistics education community is second to none utts has authored two bestselling textbooks for introductory statistics seeing through statistics first published in 1996 and now in its fourth edition and mind on statistics with robert heckard first published in 2001 and is now in its sixth edition she has held leadership roles that influence both collegiate and high school curriculum and has been a passionate advocate for statistical literacy for all publishing papers that outline what educated citizens should know about statistics even in retirement she continues to be in demand as a speaker with her most recent theme being data science ethics i was of course honored to find out that i had won but the most astounding part was the collection of letters that comprised the nomination packet and the assortment of photos testimonials and memories in the tribute book says utts i will be forever grateful to the nominators for the work they did in creating those documents and amazed that i didn t find out they were doing it jessica utts finds the clock hidden in her home after learning she had won the george cobb lifetime achievement award in statistics education according to the written testimonials utts has changed the face of statistics education and is internationally respected forward thinking visionary one person spoke of her influence on k 12 and collegiate education in the united states while another noted that as the first female statistician i had ever met you have been a role model for me yet another summarized her work as follows over the past forty years you have demonstrated excellence in teaching a variety of forward looking statistics courses innovated in creative ways published a number of foundational articles and textbooks that continue to shape the field and engaged in professional service to help foment change as the nominating letter concludes we marvel at what she has accomplished and she has done it all with humor grace and an enthusiasm that is contagious the dinsdale awardone month after receiving the george cobb award on july 27 2021 utts received the dinsdale award from the society for scientific exploration sse she learned of the honor at sse pa connections 2021 a joint online conference between the sse and the parapsychological association pa established in 1992 the award named after tim dinsdale recognizes significant contributions to the expansion of human understanding through the study of unexplained phenomena it aims to reward senior scholars who have significantly contributed to our understanding of anomalous physical biological and psychological events in the spirit of meticulous research exemplary methodology and proper scholarly attitude utts received the award for significant contributions in the rigorous application of statistical methods to the study of psi shorthand for parapsychology including remote perception presentiment and distant healing i was delighted to have my work recognized by receiving the dinsdale award and was particularly pleased that the awardee immediately preceding me was hal puthoff who first introduced me to this research area says utts who met puthoff many years ago at an see conference puthoff was the director of the government funded research program studying psychic abilities and their possible use for intelligence gathering he was looking for a statistical consultant for a program based out of sri international utts became a consultant for the program and still collaborates with parapsychology researchers to this day about half of my research publications are related to my work in parapsychology she says noting that her most prominent work was a report she put together for congress my work was a part of the full report evaluating the government work on psychic abilities commonly referred to by one of its code names stargate she says that report led to appearances on cnn larry king live and lots of other media outlets the dinsdale award appropriately spotlights how utts leveraged her ph d work in statistics and her undergraduate study of both math and psychology to push the boundaries of mainstream science and advance the field of parapsychology all while continuing to advance statistics

professional goals december 8 2021 women have been historically underrepresented in stem and that trend continues today the pew research center found that women make up 25 of computing occupations and girls make up approximately 30 of ap computer science test takers girls and women face a number of challenges in the stem field which is why uci s master of data science program aims to make stem more accessible to underrepresented groups our goal is to diversify the field of data science and break the mold we want to increase female representation in tech and also help improve social mobility for underrepresented groups in the u s mds program manager bryan mu oz said the mds program launched in fall 2021 welcomed 25 students in its inaugural class of 2022 thirty two percent of the first mds cohort are women one of them being adelynn paik who serves as one of five mds program ambassadors as ambassadors we act as representatives of the program to prospective students and potential company partners paik said we are also the first point of contact for many applicants so i hope to be a welcoming face for all to prospective mds program female candidates seeing how women like paik can thrive in computing fields is inspirational because they see how they too belong in stem having leaders and programs that strive to make stem more inclusive also helps change discriminatory attitudes that women often endure from not being taken seriously to experiencing sexist policies my challenges as a woman in stem started with two discrediting high school math teachers and have taken a number of different forms since then paik said i think the worst part is when the misogyny cannibalizes your mind and you start to make yourself small even without a perpetrator it takes work to choose not to be bitter or afraid some days more than others and to re center yourself in your own path in her position as an mds program ambassador paik hopes to contribute to the efforts to make the sciences more welcoming and supportive of women i can be part of the normalization of women excelling in this program especially in its infancy she said alongside making data science less unfamiliar to potential female students another goal that paik wants to achieve in the mds program is expanding her knowledge of data science while developing a burgeoning focus on one specific field paik s interest in data science comes from her longtime passion for stem particularly math and her undergraduate education at the massachusetts institute of technology mit she majored in systems engineering within mit s civil engineering department and received her degree in 2021 paik was also involved in two research groups at mit work of the future and glaciers group the first was the work of the future task force which was an interdisciplinary effort to analyze the impact of increasing automation on future jobs my mentor and i investigated automotive startup activity by collecting both qualitative and quantitative data paik said i was also briefly part of the glaciers group where i used computer vision to track the longitudinal movement of a glacier front as someone who decided to study systems engineering because she wanted to learn about how people move and live paik said the research she conducted at mit reflects her interests in the realms of city development transportation planning and the environment she added that her systems engineering education at mit which was rooted in mathematical and technical material translates well to her current graduate school education data science seems like the swiss army knife of majors in its applicability across fields i cannot think of an industry that doesn t make use of data in some way paik said at uci s mds program i m gaining useful skills while giving myself the chance to learn about the job landscape through offerings such as career counseling and the capstone project when paik isn t playing around with numbers you can find her taking classes on improv at the groundlings theatre school where she s a two time diversity scholarship recipient or doing stand up comedy i love that communal feeling of being in a cramped dimly lit room telling jokes to an audience and hanging out with other comedians as an asian american woman i find it s a great exercise in taking up space and defying the label that we are subservient she said what marries together the realms of comedy and stem for paik are how they empower women of color to be loud and let our talents represent us the optimism initiative and passion that paik has in her academics hobbies and beyond are sure to help her achieve her goals in the mds program in the short term i look forward to claiming a specialty within data science and starting a career in the environmental transportation healthcare or entertainment industry paik said my long term goal is to remain hopeful and work on projects with people i respect and admire karen phan disney

news seminar center for statistical consulting tech trends for 2022 january 10 2022 ics professors daniel epstein mohsen imani and tianchen qian discuss their research and the technological developments they expect in the coming year the new year starts with healthcare front and center as covid 19 continues to impact people s daily lives throughout the pandemic the fields of computer science informatics and statistics have all played an important role in helping people move their lives online stay connected and analyze vast amounts of data for informed decision making how will these fields continue to advance virtual and augmented spaces find new ways to bring people together and improve healthcare analytics and interventions in the coming year here to answer these questions while covering an array of topics including artificial intelligence ai wearables the aging population mental health and cybersecurity are three professors from the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics daniel epstein assistant professor of informatics and leader of the personal informatics everyday pie lab studies personal tracking technology and designs devices and apps that help people better track everything from health and fitness to finances and productivity mohsen imani assistant professor of computer science is working on a wide range of practical problems in the area of bio inspired computing machine learning computer architecture and embedded systems tianchen qian assistant professor of statistics works to develop methodology to understand causal relationships through the analysis of highly complex data with applications focusing on health and wearable technology the unique structure of ics as a standalone school with three departments computer science informatics and statistics makes it the perfect environment for exploring all aspects of computing and technology and the impact on society let s see what technological developments these three scholars expect to see in 2022 what technology advances are you most excited about as we head into 2022 daniel epstein epstein far from my area of expertise augmented reality has only recently become viable on people s everyday phones while i m skeptical that it will revolutionize the way we communicate with one another i m hopeful that it will help us create richer experiences once we find the right niches where the technology is really valuable i m also excited to hopefully see us take all of the big advances in conversational agents into important areas where people find them useful current research says they re mainly just used for setting timers and playing music my student lucas silva has been examining how voice assistants can make food journaling less burdensome and fit in with everyday technology use like using an alexa instead of your phone to log what you just ate while your hands are busy doing the dishes mohsen imani imani this pandemic has proven that virtual reality vr is an essential technology for our future communication vr will make significant changes in how we communicate with computers and each other it will shorten physical boundaries by giving us virtual feelings besides vr i am also excited to see the next generation of wearable devices and health monitoring technologies that could change the quality of healthcare systems tianchen qian qian i m most excited about the advances in wearable device and sensor technology and in particular their increasing applications in healthcare with these technology we are getting better at detecting the state of an individual such as stress level and location and potentially delivering behavior change interventions to them in real time this provides ample opportunity to improve health but also brings a lot of challenges such as how to balance the therapeutic effect of the interventions and the burden of receiving interventions through smartphone and wearable devices what is the next big challenge you think society will face and how will your field help epstein covid 19 forced us to radically restructure how we live and work with one another while there is certainly some appetite to return to normal for many people normal was worse or wasn t good either i think the big challenge for society is thinking through what changes for the better emerged from our situation and how do we not lose those in a foolhardy attempt to wipe the memory of the pandemic from the vantage point of informatics i particularly see us helping out in understanding how technology helped move activities that were in person to online and advocating for the things that became better from being online everything from online education to telemedicine to how people socialize with one another imani we face increasing needs for efficient and real time processing for diverse cognitive tasks using a vast volume of generated data deep learning and ai are predicted to make evolutionary changes in many areas including healthcare finance and cybersecurity to extract useful information applications often rely on sophisticated and costly machine learning and ai algorithms that lack transparency robustness and have long latency and high power consumption for realistic intelligent and effective systems to be developed and deployed there are crucial needs for scalable learning and computing methods on embedded devices for example algorithms that now run on large scale data centers with kilowatt power consumption need to be processed in real time on our daily used smart devices for example a smartwatch and smart glass this requires fundamental changes on the algorithm and underlying hardware qian the current one is obviously the pandemic which my colleagues have thoughtfully commented on the next big challenge in my view is the aging population and how to improve the quality of life for the elderly with longer life expectancy and lower birth rate the composition of the age pyramid is transitioning toward an older population and there are many challenges ahead how would the society take care of the elderly when a large proportion of the society are themselves old how can we empower the elderly with modern technology so that they can enjoy their lives without the assistance of another human for a longer period of time how can their quality of life be further improved while respecting the inevitable decline in physical and mental capabilities my collaborators from uci mind and i are investigating the early signs for alzheimer s disease and other cognitive disorders we are looking at the data from uci s 90 study where hundreds of individuals over 90 years old have been followed for years and have has their cognitive performance assessed over time we hope to identify features that can be used to predict cognitive disorders and bring new insights into the process everyone will face aging how is your field affecting people s day to day lives epstein in my mind informatics is at the forefront of taking technology advances and seriously thinking about how they can should and even shouldn t impact people s everyday lives in my specific area of personal health we re understanding how people feel about the well being technology they use every day and are testing out new ideas for improving those technologies based on research we ve seen health apps like apple health move from showing people pretty boring bar graphs of how much they walk each day to more useful insights and trends we ve also seen apps improve since earlier work in 2017 how they support people of more varied identities and goals such as menstrual health apps better supporting transgender and non binary individuals and all people across their health lifecycle some changes might feel subtle but they go a long way toward helping people get the health support they need from technology imani my research on hyperdimensional computing hdc aims to redesign algorithms using strategies that more closely model the human brain this new direction is an alternative paradigm that mimics important brain functionalities toward high efficiency and noise tolerant computation hdc is motivated by the observation that the human brain operates on high dimensional data representations hdc incorporates learning capability along with typical memory functions of storing loading information hdc has shown several advantages as the next generation of cognitive machines to enable human like intelligence first instead of requiring many iterations and data points for training hdc can learn in a single iteration from just a few examples second hdc operations are highly parallel and lightweight thus empowering online learning on our daily used smart devices finally hdc has a natural robustness to noise which is essential for current unreliable network and hardware technologies qian i would like to talk about the elephant in the room which is having a huge impact on people s day to day lives right now the covid 19 pandemic statistics has played an important role in our society s joint effort to combat covid 19 enabling us to efficiently and appropriately use data to make informed decisions it has helped us monitor cases model disease spread develop vaccines and assess their effectiveness establish guidelines on dosage and boosters and predict the future trajectory of the pandemic to guide policymaking what industry will experience the most changes based on computing advances in the next five years epstein like every year recently the question is which industries won t be heavily impacted by computing advances closest to my work i m expecting we ll reach an inflection point where healthcare takes more seriously what patients are experiencing outside of their clinical visits we re already seeing telehealth and messaging a doctor systems being widely available and used but i think we ll start seeing these systems extended to include more options for care for example at home covid tests have become big and i wouldn t be surprised to see those sorts of records be better digitized and structured to support population health but i also expect other industries will be seriously changed too imani there is no doubt that all industries will experience major changes using emerging ai techniques but i will highlight two in particular healthcare and cybersecurity ai powered health monitoring technology can help doctors prioritize patients and provide urgent care to those in the most danger thereby saving lives in addition such technology for example in the form of a lightweight wearable device like a bracelet also offers a convenient method for patients to monitor their own health ai technologies are also stepping in to help improve cyber resilience as security issues have started presenting a day to day struggle for businesses attackers are getting smarter so our cybersecurity must grow smarter too it is essential to deploy effective cybersecurity technology based on future machine learning algorithms with higher intelligence efficiency and human like reasoning capability qian i think one of them would be healthcare our healthcare model is transitioning from episodic event based care to integrated preventative and holistic care the advances in computation and ai are among the key facilitators for this transition with the rapid advances in wearable technology more and more people will be able to get care when and where they need it the most and i m not just talking about physical health mental health is an equally important aspect and its care stands to be greatly transformed by technology advances imagine someone who is trying to quit smoking wearable sensors nowadays allow us to use prediction algorithms to detect in real time when a user is stressed a big risk factor for relapse in smokers furthermore we now have the capability to immediately act on this real time prediction through digital interventions delivered through the wearable device or a smartphone such as recommending a mindfulness exercise to the individual to help reduce their stress level all these can be done without the involvement of another human being these type of smartphone and wearable based health interventions are also being developed in various other domains such as physical activity bipolar disorder substance abuse and so on i can only imagine how many more there will be in the next five years to transform healthcare and people s well being what research projects will you be focused on in the coming year epstein together with my students i m focused on moving people s health tracking practices beyond individual apps or experiences and into the complex circumstances where people use technology for example supported by an icts pilot award my student eunkyung jo is planning to bridge the gap between health data that patients collect and how doctors use that data we re planning to develop ways to annotate health questionnaires that your doctor might give you to fill out at home like symptom logs with your own data two of my other students dennis wang and xi lu are looking at what role social media should play in helping people get support and advice around the health data they collect and understanding why apps like myfitnesspal and weight watchers don t seem to be enough to serve those goals supported by snap research we ve been working on using data to help people who are meditating together become more aware of each other s mental states imani we aim to explore alternative computational models that enable further energy scaling by abandoning the deterministic requirement of today s computing systems these approaches will be particularly effective in the realization of cognitive functions such as recognition decision making and learning these functions are gaining rapid importance in a world that is infused with sensing modalities and in need of efficient information extraction qian my research focuses on the experimental design and statistical methods for developing mobile health interventions in particular i aim to develop efficient methods to utilize wearable data in order to answer the question of when where and under what context should a mobile health intervention be delivered one of the projects i will be focusing on in the coming year is a collaboration with professor pathik wadhwa from the uci school of medicine and other colleagues where we aim to develop just in time adaptive interventions for reducing stress among pregnant women and women of childbearing age this project involves building a prediction algorithm for detecting real time stress designing a micro randomized trial to collect data and constructing the algorithm to deliver the interventions in an optimal way on a more personal note what is your new year s resolution and is there anything from your bucket list you hope to cross off in 2022 epstein yikes big question i picked back up trail running this fall and did a few races for the first time in a while so my big goal there is to stick with staying active imani after two years of pandemic and remote working i believe it is finally the time to explore the world i am so excited to use summertime to travel with my family as helen keller once said life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all qian i just had a newborn in the summer of 2021 one of my new year s resolutions is to spend more time with my son and my family to cherish the moments when he is so little and so adorable

list of resources including on campus groups here at uci we also list some nationwide organizations and books that focus on diversity and race in technology as well as spotlight some black leaders in computer science and engineering both on and off campus when we think about black history month we usually begin by acknowledging those who have come before us and who are often overlooked in our society says gregory diggs yang assistant director of the stacey nicholas office of access and inclusion oai we should always honor those trailblazers but we should also recognize those great contributors who are currently widening the trail and those who are just beginning down it created in 2014 oai is a joint office between ics and the henry samueli school of engineering focused on recruiting retaining and graduating talented students from historically excluded populations the following is not meant to be an exhaustive list stresses diggs yang but rather a starting point for reflection during black history month and a way to recognize current black visionaries and new pioneers i am excited to be acknowledging the current unsung heroes of black history as it is being made creating a supportive campus culturewe start with a list of organizations at uci that are focused on supporting the black community the black faculty staff association bfsa provides a sense of purpose

alliance for minority participation is cutting edge and explores the environmental factors causing minoritized students to leave stem adams is also highly engaged in activities to increase the number of black high school undergraduate and graduate students pursuing stem fields black history month is very important to me says adams it s a chance for reflection on the strength of my ancestors which i channel into my research teaching and service i strive to be my ancestors wildest dreams and to influence the next generation of black engineers also in the samueli school of engineering assistant professor of biomedical engineering timothy downing is leading a team of interdisciplinary researchers working to uncover the molecular and physical principles of epigenome replication the project is funded through a 3 million nsf grant for research that seeks to better understand the dynamic nature of the epigenome which will open new possibilities for cellular engineering the award will also support activities that broaden participation in science among high schoolers and undergraduates including students from underrepresented groups in addition downing received 2 million in funding for a 2019 new innovator award with this work he aims to shed light on how mechanical cues integrate with and give rise to disease driving epigenetic mutations ultimately leading to the discovery of better treatment options for cancer patients black history month is a great opportunity for us all to reflect and remember to bring our full self into the edges of the social networks that we live and work in says downing it represents the idea that there s space in our society for everyone to exist and participate authentically when we do that incredible things happen in the school of ics assistant professor of informatics roderic crooks studies the intersections of race technology and public life his current project explores how community organizers in working class communities of color use data for activist projects even as they dispute the proliferation of data intensive technologies in education law enforcement financial services and other vital sites of civic concern the pursuit of science including information and computer sciences does not exempt anyone from participation in the complex dynamics and shared histories of anti black racism in the united states and across the world says crooks we are all deeply enmeshed in systems of power and privilege that benefit some and harm others based on interlocking hierarchies of citizenship wealth race class gender sexuality and disability i am encouraged by the increased willingness of our students to name these dynamics and to consider the study of structural oppression central to the work we do in ics also in the school of ics is ian harris who has been a professor in the department of computer science since 2004 his research interests include the design of secure hardware and software systems and the application of natural language understanding to security and design his current projects include the detection of phone based social engineering attacks the formalization of natural language specifications and the development of a cyber test range to evaluate the security of iot systems he is also leading a team of students participating in the mitre embedded capture the flag competition joni ricks oddie is the first full time director of the uci center for statistical consulting and is also director of the institute for clinical and translational sciences icts biostatistics epidemiology and research design berd unit by managing both ricks oddie who earned her ph d in epidemiology from ucla in 2012 has streamlined processes so the two groups operate in sync as a one stop shop for the uci community and affiliated organizations needing to collaborate with a statistician she works with a variety of organizations including chapman university and children s hospital of orange county and has organized many training sessions and workshops at uci she has a heart for working on diversity equity and inclusion dei related projects and is currently helping to lead the icts black thriving initiative strategic plan as well as working with faculty in the statistics department to expose underrepresented minority urm middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science every few decades our nation has a crisis of conscience as it pertains to its black citizenry says ricks oddie we change policies enact new laws develop diversity initiatives and commit to do better unfortunately each time the situation or crisis that initiated the movement ultimately gets forgotten and society moves on to some other more fashionable issue i truly hope this time we do not get weary in well doing and are able to sustain our commitment to making uci a place where black people are truly able to thrive and be their authentic selves shani murray 4 ics professors among 7 uci

endeavor that marries uci s powerhouse health sciences engineering machine learning artificial intelligence clinical genomics and data science capabilities to deliver the most effective health and wellness strategy for each individual person and in doing so confronts the linked challenges of health equity and the high cost of care the institute will bring a multifaceted integrated approach to what many call the next great advancement in healthcare precision medicine collects patient data history exams demographics molecular and diagnostic tests and uses the power of computer algorithms predictive modeling and ai to develop personalized treatment and lifelong health maintenance plans what we re doing at the institute for precision health is perhaps the most important step we ll take in this generation to improve health and well being said steve a n goldstein m d ph d faap uci s vice chancellor for health affairs the ever evolving capabilities of the iph herald a future of personally tailored care that fundamentally alters the healthcare landscape to place the patient at the center and in control in the past individuals were treated based on approaches thought to be best for groups of patients now we begin the iph epoch of patient centric care designed to continuously improve the health of the individual within their community even as new knowledge accrues whereby rights incentives transparency and control remain the purview of the patient goldstein added iph is an ecosystem for collaboration across disciplines that comprises seven areas smart statistics machine learning artificial intelligence designs software to integrate and analyze health records molecular data and observations the unit is led by daniel gillen professor and chair of statistics and zhaoxia yu associate professor of statistics a2ir applied artificial intelligence research designs practical solutions to real world clinical problems for cost effective value based care it is led by dr peter chang assistant professor of radiological sciences a3 applied analytics and artificial intelligence brings solutions to inpatient ambulatory and community settings and

by suzanne sandmeyer professor of biological chemistry and leslie thompson donald bren professor of psychiatry human behavior and neurobiology behavior collaboratory for health and wellness powered by syntropy houses the dynamic analytics platforms and patient controlled data at the core of the iph ecosystem the group is led by tom andriola vice chancellor for information technology and data and kai zheng professor of informatics deployable health equity employs machine learning artificial intelligence into communities to create solutions narrowing the disparities gap in the health and well being of vulnerable populations the unit is led by dr dan cooper professor of pediatrics and associate vice chancellor for clinical translational research and bernadette boden albala professor and director of the program in public health and founding dean of the planned school of population public health education and training with leadership from each area brings courses seminars certificates and degrees in statistics machine learning artificial intelligence omics and bioinformatics to practitioners and students because the disciplines included in iph already existed at uci goldstein noted it was in many ways only a small step to join them together and build a resource across campus the synergy created however is no small matter this is the giant leap for healthcare it s glaringly clear that precision health is how to increase the quality of care to decrease the cost of care by both improving how it s delivered and matching cost to value and to deliver quality healthcare to the underserved he said adding that the institute s success will be measured by improvements in individual and community health a major goal is revealing new approaches to tackle ailments that lack successful therapies for many diseases especially neurodegenerative ones like alzheimer s parkinson s and even huntington s where the causal gene is known there are simply no treatments available that change their course we re excited because we know that with precision health we have the potential to define diseases better understand them better and treat them far better said thompson iph co director we expect major breakthroughs while the vision idea for iph has long been in the works the covid 19 pandemic was a beta test demonstrating how rapidly critical medical needs could be addressed in early 2020 with elements of iph in place uci clinicians biomedical and computer scientists and public health experts joined forces to create an ai driven tool to assess the critical care needs of covid patients this app based tool the covid vulnerability index demonstrated that a data driven approach coupled with world class clinical therapeutics could help yield the best outcomes for individuals we couldn t have had a proof of concept with higher stakes than the pandemic said tom andriola iph co director we saw in real time how mobilizing our capabilities to analyze health data and make customized decisions could complement leading edge clinical treatments to save lives and reduce hospital stays additionally there is an explosion of data in healthcare and we re still only using a small fraction in decision making he added iph is including not only data from traditional healthcare settings but also the data coming from a new generation of empowered health consumers who are tracking and managing their own health journey the plan is for iph to have a brick and mortar home on the uci campus that will serve as a hub for educating data informed clinicians to practice at the top of their licenses a site for the infrastructure to facilitate translational research a place for community outreach and a venue for commercial collaborations already industry leaders such as syntropy and mitre and community partners such as children s health of orange county and the va long beach healthcare system are working with iph to leverage uci s capabilities and commitment as a fair broker for health data placing individuals first for patients the message is that uci s institute for precision health is the future of your care and well being goldstein said for the research community iph is a wide open opportunity for discoveries that matter for the business community iph is ready to partner to advance new cost effective care and for the philanthropic community the folks

with videos now making up more than 80 of all consumer internet traffic even the smallest improvements in compression algorithms can dramatically impact our ability to store and share information it has been speculated for a long time that neural networks will ultimately revolutionize data compression technologies recently such attempts have proved successful says stephan mandt an assistant professor of computer science and statistics in uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics mandt has been at the forefront of this work our group at uci has been pioneering research into using neural networks to compress data funding from an nsf career award and other nsf grants has supported this work to make their research more accessible the group recently published a survey titled an introduction to neural data compression currently undergoing peer review in april 2022 mandt and his collaborators will present two scientific papers at the international conference on learning representations iclr 2022 a globally renowned conference on cutting edge research in deep learning their first paper advances solutions to a fundamental problem in information theory while the second introduces a new model for general purpose lossless data compression understanding compression feasibilityin towards empirical sandwich bounds on the rate distortion function mandt and his ph d student yibo yang quantify the fundamental hardness of compressing real world data such as images if you ve ever paid attention to the file size of jpeg images you may notice how certain kinds of images take up more storage than others of the same dimensions explains yang it turns out that with information theory we can quantify the inherent compressibility of a given type of data using a quantity called the rate distortion function and no data compression algorithm can beat the theoretical performance limit implied by it therefore knowing the rate distortion function of the data being compressed can really help researchers assess and improve their compression algorithms although the rate distortion function can be worked out mathematically for a few simple data distributions establishing it for other data in general especially for big data of practical interest has been an open research problem with this work yang and mandt move closer to this goal by developing a machine learning algorithm that can estimate the rate distortion function of potentially high dimensional types of data such as images and voice recordings it was really exciting to see the algorithm i sketched out on paper actually work on real world data ranging from natural images and speech spectrograms to data from particle physics says yang such data would have posed an insurmountable computation challenge to the previously known method an algorithm from the 1970s still the general problem is not quite solved and i hope this work opens up new possibilities for future research toward lossless compression with machine learningin hbo s television series silicon valley a group of hackers develops a fundamentally new lossless compression algorithm it turns out that fiction is not too far from reality in a recent collaboration involving anji liu a ph d student at ucla and liu s advisor computer science professor guy van den broeck mandt contributed to a new general purpose compression approach lossless compression with probabilistic circuits published as a spotlight at iclr 2022 the idea of lossless compression is very similar to that of morse code where we abbreviate frequent letters like e by a single dit and rare letters by three dits this leads to an optimally short representation of the message says mandt the key to lossless compression is hence to reliably predict how frequently any given symbol occurs for simple data we can just count but for more complicated data like images we need predictive machine learning models while most neural compression employs popular deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks the present work uses a fundamentally different niche machine learning approach called probabilistic circuits pcs with the help of these models the researchers could dramatically accelerate relevant computations that play a key role in data compression as a result their pc based de compression algorithm runs 5 20 times faster than neural compression algorithms that achieve similar bitrates this work says mandt is a great example of how curiosity driven fundamental research can culminate in surprising unforeseeable applications that would never have been discovered otherwise shani murray uci news uci researchers receive state funding to study pandemic forecasting uci news uci s graduate programs

researchers had developed a hybrid human machine framework for ai systems that can complement human expertise from chatbots that answer tax questions to algorithms that drive autonomous vehicles and dish out medical diagnoses artificial intelligence undergirds many aspects of daily life creating smarter more accurate systems requires a hybrid human machine approach according to researchers at the university of california irvine in a study published this month in proceedings of the national academy of sciences they present a new mathematical model that can improve performance by combining human and algorithmic predictions and confidence scores the seeds for this cutting edge work by researchers in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics and the school of social sciences were first planted decades ago this collaboration started with padhraic smyth chancellor s professor in the computer science and statistics departments and mark steyvers a professor in the department of cognitive sciences padhraic smyth left and mark steyvers stand outside of donald bren hall steve zylius uci one of the really nice things about uci is that there s a lot of interdisciplinary activity says smyth whose research is supported through a qualcomm faculty award there is this culture of collaboration so cognitive scientists come to bren hall to attend our ai and machine learning talks and we go to their talks in fact smyth and steyvers have been meeting periodically since the early 2000s we d chat over coffee about our projects says smyth we speak different languages but we re both interested in intelligence just from different perspectives computer science emphasizes artificial and cognitive sciences emphasizes natural and there s a lot of overlap so when the national science foundation nsf put out a call for research related to how humans and ai work together smyth and steyvers put together two proposals both of which were funded in 2019 one grant focuses on hybrid human algorithm predictions exploring how to balance effort accuracy and perceived autonomy the other grant is an assessment of machine learning algorithms in the wild this work led to the recently published pnas paper bayesian modeling of human ai complementarity as announced by uci the paper was co authored by steyvers and smyth along with heliodoro tejeda a graduate student in cognitive sciences and gavin kerrigan a ph d student in computer science funded by the hpi research center at uci the grants have led to other papers co authored by steyvers and smyth as well they worked with kerrigan on combining human predictions with model probabilities via confusion matrices and calibration a paper appearing in proceedings for the thirty fifth conference on neural information processing systems neurips 2021 and they worked with computer science ph d students disi ji and robby logan on active bayesian assessment of blackbox classifiers a paper appearing in proceedings for the thirty fifth aaai conference on artificial intelligence this line of work is part of a larger collaboration with about five or six ph d students says smyth markelle kelly one of those students is markelle kelly a computer science graduate student who last summer received a fellowship through uci s steckler center for responsible ethical and accessible technology create this year kelly was awarded a fellowship through the irvine initiative in ai law and society both the center and initiative are helping facilitate this interdisciplinary work the human machine collaboration between the cognitive sciences and computer science departments explores questions about how people and machines can work together as a team says kelly who is currently investigating how humans and ai can understand the strengths and weaknesses of each other to better delegate tasks by working alongside cognitive science researchers i can better understand theories about the human side of this problem and incorporate these ideas into potential solutions the resulting cross disciplinary experiments and findings are founded on a much more nuanced perspective than if only machine learning experts were involved smyth agrees computer science historically has been a little bit averse to getting humans in the loop but i think ai and machine learning researchers now realize that although our algorithms have been developed and tested in our labs for a decade or two without attracting much attention they are now being widely applied to address real problems involving real people he says as a consequence getting students early in their career involved in these kinds of interesting projects and in discussions related to how ai is being used will help ensure ai is used

county and other organizations develop grant proposals calculate sample sizes interpret data and design research databases in the deforest park neighborhood of north long beach however the wife and mother of two young children is better known as a community advocate she was recently recognized by assembly member mike gipson as the 2021 woman of the year and she has long helped local residents stay engaged and empowered over the years she has served on the north long beach neighborhood alliance uptown property and business improvement district pbid and citizens police complaint commission cpcc and she is currently chair of the long beach planning commission tackling complex issues such as affordable housing now as ricks oddie campaigns for long beach city council in district 9 her professional and personal lives are growing more intertwined her data driven approach paired with strong community engagement brings a unique skill set and perspective to a platform focused on homelessness economic development and small business recovery public health parks and open spaces diversity equity and inclusion and public safety assembly member mike gipson named dr joni ricks oddie shown here with her husband and two children 2021 woman of the year for california assembly district 64 professional and personal perspectivespublic health is one area in particular that spotlights the interconnected nature of ricks oddie s professional and personal experiences part of my campaign revolves around public health outreach to minority communities and marginalized communities says ricks oddie i want to lead conversations around health equity and funding of public health programs at the city level the pandemic has really highlighted the need for more structural funding for our health department and with my background in statistics and epidemiology i want to bring a more data driven lens to how we make decisions yet ricks oddie isn t only about the numbers as highlighted in a march 7 facebook post about the birth of her daughter chloe the issue of health equity is also personal for her in the post she recounts how she gave birth to her second child in a car outside the hospital after having been sent home two hours earlier a situation that likely led to life threatening medical complications that left ricks oddie in need of surgery a few weeks later as a black woman i m acutely aware that black babies face a higher than normal infant mortality rate and that black mothers face a higher than normal mortality rate after birth these differences are rooted in the burden that black mothers face due to systematic racial bias she posted as a researcher and academic i deal with data and statistics every day on that day my daughter could easily have become a statistic in the worst possible way in chloe s honor this women s history month i d like to bring greater awareness and respect to those mothers particularly black mothers who literally risk their lives to give birth wrote ricks oddie in a facebook post for her daughter s first birthday ricks oddie goes on to say that this experience was part of her motivation to run for city council one of the reasons i m running for city council is to bring my professional and personal perspective on women s health health equity public health and community health to my work on behalf of our city she is sharing her story to build awareness and to bring a name and a voice to some of the complex challenges facing the city and to encourage others to share their stories as well she credits the black infant health program in long beach with providing her a safe space to process her experience thinking about our healthcare system in totality insurance access care representation and the issues around implicit bias is difficult because these are all things you can t necessarily prove because there are so many dynamics was race a contributing factor these are hard conversations but they re conversations that need to happen data driven solutionsat the same time ricks oddie wants to ensure that any policy changes introduced are not only supported by the data but also tracked and evaluated to properly evaluate programs in the city we need to attach appropriate metrics to assess whether changes made are even working she says i want to advocate for the creation of an office of data and evaluation which would help city departments and staff figure out what data is out there to support a particular position or program change ricks oddie s unique skill set would allow her to help identify appropriate milestones and metrics for policies and then effectively package and visualize them for presentations to the city council and other strategic partners in the city and this approach could be applied to everything from healthcare to homelessness for example she knows from her work with various organizations that it takes an average of 17 touches to persuade someone who is homeless to agree to accept help a lot of community members get frustrated when nothing happens after they make just one call but people have rights you have to develop trust with people and that takes time and resources gathering and understanding the data helps quantify the time and resources needed while also providing important context for continued community engagement from a policy standpoint we really have to think about what resources we provide our health department our social services department and our police department she says because when people call about issues around loitering somebody camping on public property or issues around mental health all of that connects a lot of city departments she stresses the need to manage these different entities at a holistic level while also educating the public about the role they play in helping to address various issues ready to hit the ground runningof the nine neighborhood associations in district 9 ricks oddie has been endorsed by eight association presidents i ve worked with them for the last decade so they trust my opinion and know that i ll be somebody who will always have an open door policy with them and a listening ear she has also been endorsed by both the previous councilmember and by current councilmember rex richardson who is running for mayor they also know that i m somebody who will fiercely advocate for our community i already have a lot of relationships going in which will allow me to hit the ground running she says and while her professional background brings a high level of analytical skills and expertise to the table it s her ability to apply those skills in support policies that will actually improve people s daily lives that matters i tell people i m raising my family here and i want them to live in a community that they re proud of where it feels like their city and their city leaders care about their well being shani murray applications open for new uci summer biostatistics

will be offering a two week session titled data data analytics theory applications from july 25 to aug 5 high school students will be on campus monday through friday from 9 a m to 4 p m exploring the foundations of data science with real world hands on projects computer science is more than just programming the whole idea behind the summer academy is to offer a selection of courses to help high school students explore the various areas and topics that comprise the ever changing and growing field of computing explains computer science professor magda el zarki the director of the academy leading this effort we re starting off with this one course on data analytics it is a great way to launch the program given the tremendous interest that students have in data it s the big thing these days camp attendees will spend their days in the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci learning about data science methods and concepts through hands on projects using anonymized health data from actual patients the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci mornings will start with lessons from professor babak shahbaba of uci s department of statistics or from professor sam behseta of cal state fullerton s department of mathematics they will be teaching students how to collect process summarize and visualize data after a daily lunch break highly qualified and trained uci graduate and undergraduate students will lead small teams working on projects related to actual datasets often drawn for biological and medical sciences the teams will make predictions using statistical models test scientific hypotheses using statistical inference techniques and make decisions under uncertainty by applying statistical thinking for the students it will be exciting to work with actual datasets and see what it s like to make sense from databases comprising a jumble of numbers and more says el zarki students will learn how to manipulate the data make the models analyze their results and present it in a way that illustrates certain interesting conclusions it will be an eye opener for a lot of kids students will also get to tour the campus visit research labs in the school s departments of computer science informatics and statistics and explore career pathways in the many related fields of computing interested students must apply online by may 6 2022 the application is short but does require the name title and email address of a teacher principal or school administrator who when contacted can submit a letter of recommendation also by the may 6 deadline there is no application fee and the 2 500 program cost covers lunches snacks and all materials required ics will provide laptops with all the software needed for the course the first cohort will likely be around 30 students the plan is for the ics summer academy to grow in offerings and cohort size the goal for next year is to offer three or four courses eventually building up to around six to eight courses by 2025 serving up to 250 students each year i m very positive about this effort for the future because i think it s very different from anything else out there says el zarki we already have faculty really interested in covering other areas the focus of future sessions might include security game development the internet of things iot ai and machine learning quantum computing and more there might also be more advanced sessions on certain topics for those interested in learning more about a particular field the goal of the summer academy is to help students explore and get a better understanding of what it means to be a computer scientist and the exciting careers that one can pursue being one says el zarki we want to give them a good sense of the diversity and vastness of the field of computing all the areas of expertise and knowledge that it encompasses and that make it so exciting shani murray dr joni ricks oddie applies data driven lens

discussing everything from chocolate milk to dating apps and referencing shows like parks and recreation and rupaul s drag race an open access book co authored by mine dogucu removes barriers to learning bayesian statistics and finds new ways to engage readers i sincerely believe that a generation of students will cite this book as inspiration for their use of and love for bayesian statistics says duke university professor yue jiang in his review of bayes rules an introduction to applied bayesian modeling crc press 2022 this is perhaps the most engaging introductory statistics textbook i have ever read that was the goal when mine dogucu an assistant professor of teaching in uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics started collaborating with alicia a johnson and miles q ott on their bayes rules book which is freely available online or can be purchased from crc press as a hard copy paperback or e book a preprint by the authors outlines their commitment to accessibility and inclusivity while writing the book we wanted to make bayesian statistics more accessible for undergraduate students everywhere particularly novice learners says dogucu and for diverse groups of learners from different backgrounds to accomplish this they deliberately included a wide variety of entertaining examples and exercises as joseph k blitzstein of harvard university notes in his foreword you will encounter a vibrant sample of applications in this book ranging from weather prediction to lgbtq anti discrimination laws and from who calls soda pop or calls pop soda to how to classify penguin species most importantly careful study of this book will empower you to conduct thoughtful bayesian analyses for the data and applications you care about not surprisingly dogucu herself first became passionate about statistics after seeing its real world use in an application area she cared about what first sparked your interest in statistics i was a math major in a small liberal arts college statistics back then was not as popular especially for the small school and there was no statistics department per se it was within the math department i decided to take a statistics class and i remember very well the moment i decided i wanted to study more statistics we were working on a dataset about hurricane katrina about housing losses and damages and i was so impressed i thought wow we can actually use math to answer useful questions of course useful means something different for everyone but for me it means helping people so using statistics to understand problems impacting people was so fascinating to me and that s when i decided i needed to take more steps to study this why is there now a need for books on bayesian statistics targeted at the undergraduate level bayesian statistics itself is not new but traditionally it has not been taught widely there are many reasons for this one reason is that it is computationally challenging second in the past there were more criticisms surrounding the subjectivity of bayesian methods it s becoming more popular because we now have greater computing power and the scientific community or part of the community has reevaluated subjectivity more schools are offering a bayesian course now another reason is that there are two big paradigms in statistics one is frequentist and the other is bayesian so if we don t teach bayesian we are not really giving our students the full picture of different approaches to statistical analysis also there s this key value that is almost always reported in scientific studies the benchmark p less than 0 05 the p value is overused and often misused in studies experts argue that when writing a whole scientific study it shouldn t all come down to just the p value and one of the suggestions in the field of statistics is to make more room for bayesian methods the american statistical association put out a statement on p values and it starts with a quote about why colleges teach p 0 05 we teach it because it s what we do we do it because it s what we teach so if we actually teach bayesian methods that s one way to help break that cycle it brings an additional perspective to statistical analyses beyond the p value we have to prepare our students for that how is uci s department of statistics preparing students i recently co authored a preprint on the current state of undergraduate bayesian education and we were looking at courses across the nation in the highest ranked 100 universities and 50 liberal arts colleges we found 46 institutions that offer a bayesian course but most of these were elective courses only four institutions required bayesian statistics and uci is very special because we were one of them we offer an undergraduate course every winter stats 115 introduction to bayesian data analysis and it s a required course for our data science program so it s not surprising that this course is accessible at the undergraduate level at uci we have many famous bayesians in our department including hal stern wes johnson michele guindani veronica berrocal and babak shahbaba so ics is just a good bayesian place and we re also collaborating with other schools for example as part of a recent nsf grant cal state fullerton will start offering a new course like ours you wanted readers to find people like themselves in the book how did you achieve that goal so we assume that our readers will have diverse backgrounds because we started with our own students and our own students have diverse backgrounds but at the same time we aimed for this book to be accessible to everyone you don t necessarily have to be an undergraduate student we wanted it to be relevant to different cultures for instance there s an example taken from u s elections with presidential candidates going through primaries although other political systems might have primaries it s not universal so to use that example we had to give the context so we tried really hard to read the book from different perspectives to make it as accessible as possible to a diverse group of learners from different backgrounds what is one of your favorite examples from the book one part of the book that i really like is the statistical model evaluation and the reason for that is because at least in the books i used to read as a student myself model evaluation mostly focused on statistical numbers for example some model evaluation criteria that we would calculate but in our book in addition to that we also focus on ethical aspects of statistical models like is the model biased how were the data collected how could the model impact individuals or society at large i really like that this is included in the book how do you think the field of statistics might change based on greater diversity and inclusion this book is not the only thing that s going to make our field more diverse i think it might create small changes like a reader might see one example in the book that they connect to or an instructor might be inspired to make their materials more accessible but these are all small water drops in the bucket of course our aspiration is to have a bigger impact on the field but that usually comes from institutional changes like providing access to more opportunities for students in addition to affordability you also made the content accessible for people with visual disabilities yes we made sure to use color blind friendly color palettes in addition the online version of the book supports alternate text that is image descriptions read by screen readers alternate text not only makes images accessible to the blind and visually impaired but also to everyone because for instance they show up in internet searches to the best of my knowledge bayes rules is the first statistics e textbook that supports alternate text and you were deliberate in whom you cited in the book and how you cited them why unfortunately the way citations work is that usually we cite people who are already cited a lot we don t go out of our way at least i didn t before writing this book to pay attention to why i was citing someone so in preparation of the book we tried to read more authors from diverse groups to make sure we were including different points of view and that s not just for the book but to benefit us as educators by reading more then we wanted to make sure the book captured all those different scholars we also paid close attention to citing trans authors correctly actually my first quarter here at uci i cited an article on transgender scholars in my blog on inclusivity before even realizing tess informatics professor theresa tanenbaum was here in my school but basically we tried really hard to check their websites so we didn t just rely on how other people cited them finally what informed your decision to make the book open access this was of course a mutual decision with my co authors and their reasons might be similar or different but from my perspective textbooks are unaffordable as a student i was on a textbook scholarship from my school so i could buy books through that luckily here at uci we even have students who have food insecurity i wouldn t want to say to them don t buy food buy my own book especially considering that students actually contributed to the book maybe not by writing it but i ve been basically using some drafts of it for three years my students found typos and helped me see what examples were most effective and i learned from their responses to the material so they were actually part of the writing process which makes it unreasonable to ask them to pay for it i don t know the exact numbers but hundreds of people are accessing the online book on a daily basis from many different countries so it s been a great decision if students cannot access the book they cannot learn from it so accessibility was our number one goal i don t think a print book would have reached as many readers shani

31 2022 the uci master of data science mds program held a q a style panel discussion on april 21 with industry leaders in data science this discussion was held in collaboration with the southern california r users group socal rug a local forum of people who use the statistical programming language r bella feng sep dadsetan and john preach were the featured panelists along with ryan benz the three of them shared their experiences working in the data science industry focusing on their career development over the years career growth bella feng the first question of the night was how one can stand out at work and form positive relationships with their colleagues bella feng head of statistical programming and clinical trial data science at biotechnology company eqrx started the discussion by encouraging everyone to be engaged and open minded feng mentioned that she got her first job because of a presentation she did at a statistical analysis system sas conference to feng it s important to build strong relationships with those around you because they can pay off in the long run in your career sep dadsetan sep dadsetan who is the executive director of real world evidence analytics at healthcare and artificial intelligence company concertai agreed with feng and emphasized the significance of knowing the structure of your company and how you interact with your colleagues to understand the impact of your role it s really important to send an email introduce yourself and try to connect with others and see what they re working on dadsetan said i think through that you ll see where you can contribute and how the company is organized john peach in addition to networking john peach principal data scientist at cloud technology company oracle and member of socal rug says using data to inform decisions and be customer focused while keeping the company vision in mind can improve your work performance and relationships with your clients for data scientists one of the big parts of the job is to be a trusted adviser your job is to help the people that make decisions make the decision that s based around what the data is telling them as opposed to what their gut says peach said make sure that what you re going to do has some real impact along the way and you should be able to identify everything that you re doing and what the impact is going to be like for the customer biotechnology company seer s director of data science and socal rug member ryan benz led the latter half of the panel s discussion on career growth with a lighting round to discuss career growth and pitfalls ryan benz benz and the panelists noted that being curious dependable and a problem solver and having people skills are signs that an employee may be ready to be promoted when asked to share some examples of what might set back professionally they said being indecisive and having a limited or negative mindset may hurt you to avoid stumbling in your career peach re emphasized looking at the bigger picture and advised performing at the level you want to be promoted to and taking ownership of your work management vs individual contributor career tracksthe panel discussion shifted to focus on two career tracks being a manager versus being an individual contributor peach described one of the differences between being a manager and an individual contributor being the scope and type of their responsibilities while individual contributors manage themselves and are responsible for their projects a manager s role entails managing people such as overseeing personnel and creating teams in that sense being a manager is almost like being a parent according to feng dadseten added that good managers understand the scope of their own knowledge and skills and will help you find the support you need if they cannot personally provide certain resources the panelists then discussed how one knows if being a manager or an individual contributor is the right role for them understanding how you want to manage your impact at work is one thing to consider to give an example peach noted that being a technical leader allows you to have an impact throughout your organization but your impact is still focused on your area of expertise on the other hand a manager will have a broader impact on both projects and the people they re guiding as you re going up the ic individual contributor track ask yourself if you are enjoying the project management aspects more than you re enjoying the technical hands on work peach said that s a good indication that maybe taking on some management role would be interesting to you being a manager also gives you more influence in the workplace which is one of the things feng enjoys i really like the influence part said feng adding that she championed the use of r in a previous role but was unsuccessful because she was not a decision maker so once there was a reorganization my initiative was killed because everything was outsourced but right now i m not an individual contributor and more like the decision maker so i can decide dadsetan said that as you progress in your career it s good to take note of what you like and dislike and what you re good at and not good at because these are all factors that come into play when deciding what role you find best fits you i think it s important to realize that it s not a decision you have to make now and can never go back to ever dadsetan said there s relatively fluidity balancing personal professional lifecareer advancement inevitably comes with more expectations and responsibilities that can even interfere with your personal life benz said that managing stress and experiencing burnout are not talked about enough even in school so the panel discussion ended with everyone sharing how they handle the demands of their careers dadsetan acknowledged that you might hit the ground running straight out of college but it s imperative you don t overwork yourself and start drawing lines as needed as an individual you have to balance being fresh out of school wanting to make a good impression wanting to do your best so that might require you to work overtime dadsetan said but it s also really important to be listening to your body and know what it is that you want to prioritize in your life and take stock of what matters to you setting boundaries at work is also a way that feng maintains a healthy work life balance in the past she juggled a number of roles and responsibilities all at once at work causing her to burn out feng said attending a weeklong retreat and connecting with herself without electronics helped her recover and be more in tune with her body another way to prevent burnout is by learning to separate your personal and professional life it s a job it s not my identity peach said for a very long time my self identity was tied to what i was doing making that separation has helped a lot it can also help to find purpose in your career so that you are moving up learning new things and specializing rather than being stuck doing the same tasks or trying to do everything at once i personally am much better if i know that i m having personal growth i m learning a lot peach said focus on where your talents are as you go up in your career you re going to be more and more specialized in what you re known for so focus on doing that as opposed to doing everything karen phan don t think you can learn bayesian statistics think again with bayes rules qu elected international statistical institute member quick links news archive

expo held in the new state of the art interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb the event was a culmination of months of hard work offering the students the opportunity to present projects completed for undergraduate capstone courses in informatics computer science and data science as well as for the butterworth product development competition project sponsors and students alike look forward to this annual opportunity to highlight projects they ve labored over throughout the year students presenting their work in the iseb lobby at the ics project expo partnering with industry the expo really ties together the four foundational elements of engagement that our programs offer project experience entrepreneurship mentorship and opportunities for internship says jason king senior associate director of corporate relations in ics the expo benefits project sponsors looking to recruit and showcases all the great work of our students these ics undergraduates spent anywhere from 10 to 20 weeks experiencing hands on learning working on real world projects collaborating with industry partners peter colligan a senior technology executive for the sap s 4hana industry cloud was one of 40 industry professionals in attendance at the expo speaking of sap s goal of helping to accelerate collaboration between academia startups and industry colligan stresses the importance of these types of events i get a chance to directly and informally interact with student teams and talk about the engineering skills and projects they care about those discussions can sometimes go deeper where professors themselves step in and get a chance to highlight and validate ideas and common challenges with industry practitioners he continues very realistic and concrete outcomes have come out of this such as ideas for future capstone projects full time employment work or joint industry research initiatives jason king thanks the corporate partners gaining real world experiencerecognizing the tremendous benefits of providing opportunities for practical application and industry engagement the department of informatics has been offering a capstone course for more than a dozen years it is now a graduation requirement for informatics and ics has also added elective undergraduate capstone courses for computer science and data science majors presenting your work professionally in a conference like event is a very valuable experience for our undergraduate students says computer science professor sergio gago masague who launched the computer science capstone course in 2020 i personally enjoyed watching students and sponsors engaging in very interesting discussions about projects and ideas for future work one of the top computer science capstone projects leveraged artificial intelligence to create a personalized recommendation system for quick service restaurants qsrs for the ai driven personalized menu content for the qsr drive thu project students ezra hammond rieko konishi arian namavar and ryan sakuma partnered with delphi display systems they developed a machine learning system that presents relevant items to users based on their preferences and dietary restrictions to improve the drive thru experience they also presented their project and competed at the national capstone design conference in dallas texas on june 6 2022 the capstone project gave me the confidence that after my four years of education under the school of ics i am ready to tackle new and unfamiliar projects successfully and implement what i ve learned says namavar who graduated in june during the interviews i had with various companies i would always answer their questions with my experience with our ics capstone sponsor and project in mind which i think helped me secure an offer namavar will be working as a software developer at nisum the ics expo was also a great opportunity to present our project and take ownership of our result seeing the progress other students made was another aspect that made me proud of ics informatics lecturer darren denenberg was similarly impressed by the students progress noting that everyone was able to achieve something great with their capstone but he was most surprised by the audioscribe project by alexis diaz ellen kulla jinli duan qiantai duan and yuan wang they did a project on cough diarization says denenberg it was a project i thought no one would be interested in and it ended up being one of the best groups best projects and they also went to dallas to compete in the national capstone conference professor denenberg left and ics dean marios right listen to students pitch their products informatics professor hadar ziv attended the conference with the audioscribe team and says they represented themselves and the school of ics very well they really held their own conducting multiple high quality presentations and enjoying their interactions with their peers and with capstone instructors from around the country however even students who don t have space in their schedule for a capstone course or conference or who aren t upperclassmen have opportunities for entrepreneurship thanks to the butterworth competition this product development competition is designed to encourage the creation of new technologies with the potential for commercialization this year s winning project leprendo was on display at the ics project expo letting participants view the online farmer s marketplace created by computer science major dylan riffle computer science and engineering major kanu chandra business administration major dan ta and psychological sciences major nina nguyen by developing our pitch deck and going through the competition we learned the importance of being able to combine the technical development of a product with business development and communicate this effectively says riffle the team will continue to develop leprendo over the summer we re firing on all cylinders and increasingly promoting the value of capstone projects showing why regional and national companies should be involved with these programs and the talent pipelines they offer says king our programs are

some of the benefits of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics aside from the fact that it s the only computing focused school in the uc system and happens to sit in the middle of silicon beach it also offers capstone courses that provide hands on experience in a practical real world environment the strength and importance of such programs was reiterated june 6 8 2022 when ics faculty students and staff attended the national capstone design conference in dallas texas i came away from the capstone design conference even more convinced that providing hands on practical experience is essential to prepare our students for life after college says informatics lecturer matthew bietz during his projects in human computer interaction capstone course students take all of the skills they have learned in ics classrooms and put them together in the context of a software development project these projects require students to balance real world priorities deadlines and resource constraints they have to understand client needs and figure out how to best meet them given their team s strengths and weaknesses he explains our capstone program gives our students a real competitive edge in the job market this year some of the top students from the ics undergraduate capstone program with course offerings for informatics computer science and data science majors traveled to dallas to present their projects at the same time ics faculty and staff learned about and shared best practices uci students taking a break from the conference to explore plano texas sharing best practicesone goal of the biennial capstone design conference is to provide a forum for sharing ideas it features sessions focused on how to engage industry partners bring in dollars for philanthropic support manage courses and so on the conference gave us the chance to find out what is working and not working at other schools learn about tools and techniques for organizing and teaching capstone courses and network with colleagues says bietz it also gave him the opportunity to share some best practices from ics collaborating with informatics professor hadar ziv who has been leading capstone courses in ics since 2009 bietz co authored a paper for the conference on empowering capstone students in client interactions they point out in the paper that most student training has been in classroom settings where the structure of tasks is well defined the expectations are clear and the instructor is an absolute authority they argue that a critical lesson gained from the capstone experience is learning how to have a productive disagreement with a client ziv also co authored a paper with colleagues from texas a m and from brazil on adapting scrum ceremonies in undergraduate capstone projects the paper talks about getting student teams to follow agile values and principles and scrum activities and best practices while acknowledging important differences between a scrum team in the real world and undergraduate students in a capstone course these were just two of the more than 30 papers and posters presented at the conference ziv also presented two workshop sessions in collaboration with uci alumnus david ochi director of the beall student design and butterworth product development competitions the workshops covered how to generate ideas and how to translate projects into startups ics had a strong showing at the conference not just by the number of papers posters workshops and other activities but also by a strong attendance and active engagement with all other attendees says ziv our presence was well noticed and well received jason king senior associate director of corporate relations in ics agreed noting that it was a win win situation we attended this conference hoping to take away some golden nuggets or gems learning from other institutions he compared it to being an athlete seeking out better competition during training if you truly want to grow and be the best soccer player you need to get outside of your region to compete against other players to raise that bar and this is a perfect example of that he explains this is the first time we ve gone outside of our region and it s only helping us grow now we re opening up those communication channels and people respect our feedback and vice versa presenting projects and networkingwhile half of the conference focused on best practices the other half focused on student engagement with students competing presenting and networking with their peers and also meeting with high school students interested in computer science and engineering our students who attended the conference were amazing says bietz presenting their projects in a competitive poster session was a great learning experience and they got great feedback from the judges and other attendees the conference also provided an opportunity for them to network with students from other schools meet representatives of tech companies and strengthen their bond with each other connecting with other students was a highlight for jessie chang a business information management major who presented her team s project canvas tools for teachers the tools she helped design aim to alleviate common challenges in the existing education model i enjoyed meeting new people the most there were so many different teams from different parts of the countries she says it was just really cool meeting them and learning about their projects she added that she learned a lot about engineering the conference seems more geared toward engineering students so it was a surprise to all of us that our projects were even accepted as it was all software king noted that the conference is making an effort to incorporate more computer science students and projects into its biennial event the capstone conference in dallas was a fantastic opportunity to showcase two quarters of hard work as well as engage with students and professors from all over the united states says software engineering major ellen kulla who presented the audioscribe cough diarization project with teammates alexis diaz jinli duan qiantai duan and yuan wang audioscribe developed in a capstone course taught by informatics lecturer darren denenberg analyzes different sounds for use in clinical research and healthcare settings the conference adds kulla really showed us how much students are able to accomplish as a group in a short period of time jason king front right with audioscribe team members another ics project presented was developed by computer science students ezra hammond rieko konishi arian namavar and ryan sakuma the students collaborated with delphi display systems in a capstone course taught by computer science professor sergio gago masague to develop a recommendation system for quick service restaurants qsrs my team had the opportunity to attend the conference and it was an amazing experience getting to represent the school of ics and interact with sponsors companies colleges and universities from all over the u s and canada says namavar their project ai driven personalized menu content for the qsr drive thru uses a machine learning system to present relevant items to users based on their preferences and dietary restrictions cultivating that competitive edge the capstone program is the one of the best things about ics showcasing the great work that s going on within the school from undergraduate students says king the program provides opportunities for internships and professional development helps students learn how to apply technical skills and use various project management and communication tools and lets them practice soft skills and networking in a real world environment we want to make sure we re using best practices when it comes to these offerings and that our program is on par if not better than other standout schools across the nation says king this

from july 11 through august 19 2022 twenty three students from around the u s came to uci for the newly launched irvine summer institute in biostatistics and undergraduate data science isi buds the institute is part of the summer institute in biostatistics program offered through the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid this year uci became only the 10th university in the nation to host this free six week summer training course aimed at addressing the growing need for biostatisticians and data scientists offered through the department of statistics in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics the isi buds program provides not only training in the fundamentals of biostatistics data science and computing but also experience in conducting cutting edge biomedical research the main goal is to excite students about careers and graduate school in biostatistics says statistics professor vladimir minin who co directs the program with ics colleagues dan gillen babak shahbaba and mine dogucu careers in biostatistics are peculiar in the sense that a lot of them require a graduate degree so there s a need for more training in this area explains minin however biostatistics is rarely taught at the undergraduate level so many undergraduate students do not know about career opportunities in this area sarah schlund a senior at uc santa barbara double majoring in statistics and data science and in geography agrees i had been searching for an opportunity to gain experience in biostatistics prior to committing to a five year doctorate program in the field however such opportunities are few and far between she says isi buds offers the rare opportunity to gain biostatistics experience as an undergraduate and learn from the very impressive faculty at uci who have immense biostatistics knowledge and experience both in industry and academic research ics faculty members and the inaugural cohort of students for the irvine summer institute in biostatistics and undergraduate data science an impressive inaugural cohortthe inaugural cohort of students selected from more than 150 applications came from a wide variety of schools including the university of connecticut emory university montana state university the university of arizona university of michigan university of vermont and university of washington there was also a regional presence with students from uci uc riverside uc santa barbara and ucla the highly competitive program includes up to 500 in travel expenses free housing and a meal plan or a 2 500 stipend as well as 600 for incidental expenses the cohort was also a diverse group of students with almost 40 coming from groups that are underrepresented in the quantitative sciences we were able to recruit a significant number of students from historically excluded backgrounds with the hope of increasing diversity in the field of biostatistics says minin that was a very important goal because many are first generation college students who typically lack information about graduate school and about the many career options open to them the program included career preparedness activities including a workshop on the grad school application process and a q a with ph d students and outlined classes that students should take to have a more competitive application making this information available to everyone levels the playing field a little bit explains minin people from pharmaceutical and biotech companies including uci data science graduate jessica george came to talk with students about careers in the biotech industry in addition communications coach bri mcwhorter gave a two hour workshop on how to present scientific information helping prepare students for their research presentations on the final day of the program karren messer who is a professor and chief of the division of biostatistics at the herbert wertheim school of public health at uc san diego gave a talk and offered students valuable feedback on their presentations it was a very impressive group of students says gillen chair of the uci department of statistics they came in and within six weeks they did three weeks of courses both on technical and soft skills and then they jumped right into three weeks of real research pounding out an amazing amount of work and giving wonderful presentations at the end of it real world research a smashing successstudents attending the program started with lectures and labs conducted by six different instructors and a statistics ph d student teaching assistant learning how to design and analyze clinical trials model infectious disease dynamics and analyze big data in genomics transcriptomics and imaging the students came from various backgrounds so we spent the first three weeks making sure they were all on the same page in terms of their technical knowledge says minin we devoted this time to checking off all the boxes of what they needed to know for their research projects students then worked under the supervision of research mentors in addition to statistics professors gillen minin and shahbaba the following also served as mentors louis ehwerhemuepha manager of computational research choc research institute lauren gyllenhammer assistant professor of pediatrics uci daniel parker assistant professor of population health and disease prevention uci elizabeth read assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering uci and pathik wadhwa professor of psychiatry human behavior uci the real heart of the program was the research projects and that was only possible because of the dedication of the biomedical scientists whom we asked to participate says minin it was a smashing success because of their engagement with the students in addition four statistics ph d students provided invaluable support to the teams during the project phase of the institute the research covered the following topics analyzing the impact of maternal stress volatility during pregnancy on child health outcomes predicting maternal stress during pregnancy understanding movement patterns of farmers and forest workers from the thailand myanmar border conducting a spatio temporal analysis of melioidosis cases in lao people s democratic republic uncovering gene gene interaction motifs from single cell transcriptomic data and assessing associations between congenital conditions and covid 19 severity in children i was motivated to apply to this program because i was thrilled to get my hands on some real world biomedical data do collaborative research and learn from world class experts in statistics by means of the uci department of statistics faculty says dante ramirez an undergraduate majoring in statistics and minoring in bioethics at the university of washington what i liked best about the program was the opportunity to collaborate with like minded statisticians in a clinical research setting working with a cohort of statisticians and data scientists with relatively homogeneous skills in this setting and being guided by statistical mentors is such a special opportunity in learning my own strengths and weaknesses how to effectively communicate and work with others and how to do contemporary clinical and quantitative research although ramirez had originally intended to go straight into industry after graduating he has since changed his plans the isi buds program convinced me to apply to a biostatistics or public health graduate school program as this would make my goal of transitioning into a public health regulatory position much more attainable the research groups have some fun after giving their presentations left vladimir minin pink shirt and right dan gillen blue shirt with their student groups exploring so calboth ramirez and schlund were impressed by the research experience gained as well as by the ability to enjoy some downtime and explore southern california i was pleasantly surprised with the culture of the department and how plentiful the weekend activities were says ramirez as they were very conducive of bonding between my cohort and meeting various graduate students schlund agreed the professors also made large efforts to get to know us personally outside of dedicated lecture and research time they planned and attended weekend events that included kayaking whale watching hiking etc she says every professor in the program has been exceptionally personable kind and genuine to every student in the program summer 2023isi buds has secured funding for a minimum of five years so planning for summer 2023 is already underway registration will open in march 2023 and you can visit the application page for more information we want to make sure that we re feeding a diverse pipeline for the stem fields in general but also for biostatistics and statistics says gillen so we re going to continue to grow the program we hope that it becomes a hallmark of the department to be able to attract bright students into the graduate programs not just at uci but for many programs this is a great way to introduce students to biostatistics shani murray professors nan and gillen receive 1 8m grant to study statistical methods for alzheimer s researchsocal data

complex data analysis this demand is the backdrop for the socal data science program a collaborative effort between faculty from uci california state university fullerton csuf and cypress college aimed at recruiting training and dispatching a diverse workforce of stem and data science majors led by statistics professors babak shahbaba and mine dogucu of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics and mathematics professor roberto pelayo the program is funded through a national science foundation grant preparing a diverse workforce via academic and industrial partnership with 1 5 million in funding across the three institutes and over the next three years the goal is to recruit 120 fellows from the three campuses offering targeted coursework and hands on training research opportunities and career development workshops the program is off to a strong start with 32 fellows selected from a pool of more than 200 applicants this diverse cohort is 87 women and students from other historically underrepresented backgrounds having such a diverse and strong group of students is amazing says shahbaba that was one of the goals of the program students and faculty of the socal data science program during the winter and spring this first cohort of students took data science courses developed through the socal data science program and offered at uci csuf or cypress college then the students put their new skills to the test with a summer research project rigorous training at summer bootcampprior to starting the six week research project students attended a one week bootcamp at uci the topics covered included exploratory data analysis advanced r programing and generalized linear models we had students coming from different backgrounds and fields computer science statistics biological sciences and we wanted to make sure that before they started doing research they had the required skills says shahbaba the bootcamp brought everyone together in terms of research preparedness the students really helped each other and worked well together the bootcamp also included a session on ethics in data science as well as training in professional and academic development we focused on more than just data science covering resume writing and interview skills says shahbaba and we invited graduate students to talk about their experiences in grad school real world research experienceonce the bootcamp ended students broke into several groups with each group diving into a real world data analysis project it was six weeks of intense research says shahbaba they were on campus at least three days a week from 10 a m to 4 p m working in the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci designed for collaborative research it s such a well designed space for these kind of projects it made our collaboration with the industrial and academic partners very smooth and productive students collaborating

sensing chrs the fleischman lab the fortin lab and the reich lab the program was an amazing experience for me because it really gave me a chance to apply skills i learned from my courses to real world problems says program fellow giles pierre carlos a data science major at uci i was able to apply the techniques i ve learned and build significant models for an extremely interesting area of neuroscience research at the undergraduate research symposium on aug 4 2022 the last day of the summer program carlos and his teammates presented their work on understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of memory their project modeling nonspatial sequence memory task using neural decoding leveraged data provided by dr norbert fortin and the fortin lab at uci the program was collaborative in nature and because of that i learned how to solve statistical problems in a team setting says carlos on top of that the program solidified my interest in obtaining a master s in statistics and even made me open to going for a ph d in the future overall the program made a huge impact on where i want to take my career alyssandrei parinas who is studying computer science at cypress college and

september 22 2022 in july 2022 the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics welcomed hengrui cai as an assistant professor of statistics can you tell us a bit about your background and how you decided on statistics i m originally from southeastern china and i m the only child in my family growing up my mom and my grandma encouraged me to be independent and to seek a career i would enjoy and fight for my entire life when i took the exam to go to college i got full marks in mathematics this gave me the confidence to choose a mathematics related major as an undergraduate student at zhejiang university what inspired me to do a deep dive into the statistics major was the fourth industrial revolution happening during that time related to the realization of society version 5 0 we re in the process of imagining some new society where we will heavily rely on big data to solve challenges and to figure out how people can use artificial intelligence to live better therefore i decided to get a minor in the advanced honor class of engineering education at chu kochen honors college which granted me great opportunities to work with outstanding peers across the university and learn cutting edge technologies to integrate statistics and machine learning elegantly what motivated you to then earn your ph d during my undergraduate i attended several mathematical and machine learning competitions and won the meritorious winner in american mathematical contest yet i could still see my limitations in knowledge which motivated me to reach for the highest standard and become an expert in statistics and machine learning after a summer research internship at the university of alberta in canada i decided to go abroad for higher education and came to the united states after earning my bachelor s degree i spent five years at north carolina state university and got my ph d in statistics under the co supervision of dr wenbin lu and dr rui song my dissertation was on optimal decision making and policy evaluation with complex data which leverage causal inference and reinforcement learning to help us make the right decisions for the right people at the right time during that time i also spent three years interning at amazon that was another excellent opportunity for me to see the real world impact of computer science and statistics and how our research contributes to industry and society can you talk about your research focus i have broad research interests in methodology and theory in causal inference reinforcement learning and graphical modeling and in how they interact to establish reliable powerful and interpretable solutions to a variety of real world problems currently i m working in two main directions one is personalized decision making and policy evaluation for complex data this area integrates the techniques of causal inference and reinforcement learning which enables us to answer counterfactual questions so we can make better decisions in an interactive environment some use cases include precision medicine and personalized recommendations in e commerce i m also very interested in causal discovery with emerging challenges in big data this area leverages causal inference and graphical models to disentangle the complex relationship among variables and deliver the results in an explainable way my long term research goal is to teach a machine to learn the logic from the facts so what brought you to uci first of all i love irvine this city is vivid elegant and multicultural with a lot of young tech companies presenting appealing opportunities for collaboration the second reason is owing to the great research communities inside uci and around the uc system there are so many outstanding faculty members here i would like to work with in my department in the school of ics and across the university also where else can we find the departments of statistics computer science and informatics all in the same school it s a very unique place what courses will you be teaching i will be teaching a course in spring 2023 for undergraduates called introduction to probability and statistics in the future i would like to design some new courses on reinforcement machine learning and on causal discovery is there a book you d like to recommend to students the book of why by judea pearl and dana mackenzie this book is for non technical people who are interested in causal discovery explaining how we understand or formulate causality in real problems and highlighting the difference between correlation and causation it helps us understand the logic of things happening dive into the essence of human thought and use the causal principle as the key to applying artificial intelligence to solve real problems in meaningful ways what do you do in your spare time i like hiking going to the beach and being out in the sunshine i also like to go kayaking and standup paddle boarding if i have a bit more time i like to travel to new places i ve only been in irvine for a few months and i ve already been to las vegas death valley antelope valley and san francisco then from san francisco i drove down the coast to los angeles next i plan to visit san diego and yosemite work hard play hard i enjoy different views which open my eyes and my mind i also like to watch movies to experience different lives one of my favorites is forrest gump hengrui cai at death valley left and along california state route 1 right finally what do you like best so far about uci the people here are so nice i have received a lot of support from my department chair faculty members and department staff during my relocation and onboarding which is extremely helpful for the early stage of my career there are also plenty of opportunities for collaborating and i have been invited to give some talks for example i gave a talk in early september on optimal subgroup identification via constrained policy tree search for choc research i will continue to explore the fantastic research community at and around uci as i study how statistics and machine learning can uniquely contribute to interdisciplinary solutions and i will

of its early graduates uci is where i began my career as a computer scientist and software engineer he said while at uci i met another person who was a graduate student at the time and we ended up working together well into the 1980s you could say uci is where all of my success really started butterworth said he would not have been able to complete his college education without the monetary

long beach city council member watch her inauguration online starting at minute 58 30 as a child joni ricks oddie would often join her grandfather at county commissioner meetings in chicago so it s no surprise that when ricks oddie was sworn in for her new seat on the long beach city council on dec 22 2022 she had her family in tow she took her oath of office with her right arm raised and her left arm holding her young daughter as a wife and mother of two small children it is of utmost importance to me that we make our civic spaces open welcoming and inclusive teaching the next generation the necessity of civic engagement she said during her inauguration speech that lesson starts with them seeing their parents have the ability to be full members and make their voices heard i want to lead by example and let people know families are always welcome in addition to exemplifying her life as a mom in support of family friendly civic spaces ricks oddie also spotlighted her work in epidemiology and statistics in support of more impactful leadership as someone with a science and research background i want to bring data and metrics to the way we make decisions in the city she noted to ensure we are making the most well informed decisions on the ways we invest in our city particularly our most vulnerable communities ricks oddie earned her ph d in epidemiology from ucla and now serves as director of the center for statistical consulting housed in uc irvine s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics she is also director of the biostatistics epidemiology and research design berd unit within uci s institute for clinical and translational sciences icts this professional backdrop gives her a unique understanding of the power of data and as she takes on her new role as council member for the city of long beach representing district 9 she plans to leverage that knowledge to positively impact her community what was the most memorable part of your inauguration the official swearing is at the city clerk s office but the public inauguration ceremony was a ton of fun i had my friend and mentor yvonne wheeler who is president of the l a county federation of labor swear me in and my husband and two kids were supposed to be on stage with me but my son had to go to the bathroom he said he couldn t hold it so my father in law took him as i was giving my speech but it worked out perfectly because my speech talked about the importance of family and children and civic engagement the reason i bring my kids to everything is to make it an inclusive space for families i live in a community of young people of color so we have a lot of families moving in how are we going to grow the next generation of civic leaders if people aren t comfortable bringing their kids so it starts with us as leaders demonstrating that it s okay so just as i finish talking about this and i m shaking hands with some of the other city council members my father in law returns with my son i pick him up and give him a hug and then he says i wanna say something and he grabs the microphone and says hi i m cohen many people thought that was the highlight of the event it was a perfect example of the importance of family and just being a mom in the middle of all that so that was my favorite moment joni ricks oddie holding her son at the inauguration ceremony for the long beach city council how does your position as director of the center for statistical consulting help you in this role at my second city council meeting we announced an emergency declaration on homelessness we have an emergency operation center called the elc and we have around a 100 staff members in long beach dedicated to spending the next 100 days focusing completely on homelessness and sending us reports so the friday before our second meeting is when we got our homelessness report and it was 100 pages i had to read and analyze the report before our tuesday meeting this is the benefit of having somebody with a ph d who is used to looking at data and quickly determining what s happening joni ricks oddie at a city council meeting i ll give you another example there was a slide talking about race and ethnicity related to homelessness because we re trying to approach the problem with an equity lens to identify which racial groups are most heavily impacted in long beach it s african americans so on this one slide there were two data points that just seemed contradictory to each other one was saying that black people tend to spend the fewest days unhoused but they were also vastly more likely to be back on the street 12 months after being housed like 62 compared to the 20 for the next highest group which were white people so what the heck is happening that we get black people off the street quickly but within a year we are back where we started in the meeting i pointed out that this cycle is alarming i then had residents and advocates thanking me for the depth of my questions because i m not sure others had enough time to review the data to make that connection how do your efforts to address the needs of your community give you a different lens for viewing your work in academia it s the importance of implementation we do all this research but we often don t get to see the final dissemination and implementation how do we take what we do and literally translate it into something that impacts people that s exactly what i get the opportunity to do now which is why the work is so important it s basically asking how do you take best practices which is what we re supposed to be doing here as researchers and implement that but then the counterpoint is if we re trying to implement these policies what s the feedback loop to research that s what s missing which is why i think somebody with my background is important to have in a position like this we don t have the feedback loop to know which programs and policies didn t work out the way we thought they would when scaled for a larger audience but having that knowledge can inform how we do our research and create useful interventions you ve said that you want to advocate for an office of data and evaluation why is that important data is great and information is great but what are you going to do with it how can it influence policy and help you apply for grants that can lead to interventions i m hoping to demonstrate to my council colleagues over time that data tells you a story and then based on that story you can present a series of policies to address inequities the level of challenges that we re dealing with right now impresses the need for a holistic view we have to do many things all at once if we re actually going to make an impact which means you need to understand the full breadth of the issue i m building the case right now for eventually hiring a unit of people with expertise in gathering and analyzing data to get the whole story and give us that holistic view ricks oddie on the campaign trail with her daughter in addition to homelessness you also want to focus on health equity which became personal for you after the birth of your daughter how do you plan to tackle that issue when it comes to the issue around health equity this is actually related to black residents as well so i have been working over time with what s called the black health equity collaborative an organization born out of the framework for racial reconciliation that the city of long beach implemented right after the murder of george floyd the document was designed to make the city accountable toward its black residents it includes milestones metrics and objectives on how to engage with black residents out of that we started exploring how to tie things together to focus on communities of color we already had an office of equity we already had a health department but how do we make sure each community is getting the attention that it needs black residents need it latino residents need it our pacific islander groups need it including our samoans our tongans our chamorro population who are barely even a blip in the data they re never disaggregated out i talked to several of them when i was knocking on doors campaigning and they said they don t even feel visible most of the time at the city level so when we talk about health equity it s about being intentional about those communities that have been marginalized historically and don t even get a voice at the city level and really engaging them with them to uplift their voices and their needs there s a lot of work to do can you also talk about your efforts to expose underrepresented minority urm middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science stephanie reyes tuccio is the assistant vice chancellor for uci s center for educational partnerships cfep which has a group of managers under her that focus on urm students so statistics professor veronica berrocal and i participated in one of their workshops for students in the long beach paramount and compton school districts we did a presentation talking about statistics and what you can do with it and we recruited some students of color from the department of statistics to share their experiences i ve done a couple of presentations with veronica through the cfep talking about the work we do and trying to collaborate with them on projects so ics can be a partner in general but it s interesting because when talking about careers this isn t a pipeline problem it s a recruitment problem we need to better target urm student blocks and expose them to open positions i m a black woman so i have a much more diverse network but you have to be intentional about building a network that is diverse enough to attract the best candidate don t tell me there s no black people or latino people for a position they re out there what are we doing to find them this relates to your icts black thriving initiative strategic plan can you tell us about that after george floyd s murder icts the institute for clinical and translational science started a working group that fall a visioning process about how icts could join with uci s black thriving initiative bti we were trying to assess how we could leverage the resources at icts to double down on our commitment to diversity and make sure we were doing our due diligence to increase the diversity of the clinical translational sciences because historically as much work as it does icts as an entity has not been super diverse again it s just levels of intentionality so we drafted what i think is a comprehensive plan that leverages our strengths and talks about regional partnerships we came up with a series of goals metrics and objectives that map to the three pillars of bti leverage the mission change the culture and engage black communities that was fall of 2020 so how s it going it s been really great we ve been engaging with our education unit to get them to increase the number of nih diversity supplements contacting eligible researchers we ve had a lot of success with that over the last couple of years going from around two supplement applications to six with i think five out of those six being awarded we re also making sure our labs and research groups have culturally competent researchers so when students of color come in they have a sense of belonging and feel comfortable it s all these little interventions you need to do along the way to make things easier and more inclusive we also have a steering committee for the icts that meets every week and we have speakers come in quarterly to talk about different topics related to dei diversity equity and inclusion such as race as a biological versus social construct because race is often controlled and included in analyses and most people don t really know why they include race so we re teaching researchers to critically think about those things or we ve talked about precision of language we had a researcher dr monica mclemore of the university of washington talk about how people use words like equity diversity and inclusion and conflate all these terms without really understanding what they mean we ve also had people talk about workforce development in the clinical space to not only recruit a diverse set of students and faculty but also to think about our clinical trials because we re often testing things on a very specific group demographic we found out the problems of that during the pandemic i don t know if you heard about what happened with the pulse oximeters for measuring your blood oxygen levels but research has shown that the darker your skin the poorer the reading black people with darker skin would go into the emergency room saying i can t breathe but the pulse oximeter reading would say you re at 100 oxygen saturation so the doctors would say you re fine because the finger oximeter couldn t read through darker skin these are things we need to think about during clinical trials when we re testing devices the color of someone s skin matters this ties back into the question of what kind of data you re getting and whether you re getting the full picture from that data on that note and given that it s black history month is there something you d like to share as a source of inspiration there s a book called black like me it s old it s literally like a 50 year old book originally published in 1960 but it s basically the true story of a gentleman a journalist who s white john howard griffin who darkens his skin and then goes to live in the south as a black man it is a fantastic book because you re still the same person but once you remove the privilege of your skin the author experienced what it is like to live through the lens of not having the privilege of whiteness i remember reading that book back when i was maybe in high school and it s a great read and i still remember it to this day anything else you d like to add if there s anyone out there who s interested in the work i m doing on city council or who wants to be a resource or to bend joni s ear on an issue let me know there s going to be times

scientist john peach moderated the discussion which included panelists sarah nooravi christopher talucci and matt weiss who shared their knowledge and experiences on machine learning optimizations mlops and career development with the data science community mlops in the industryone of the first questions peach asked the panelists was what tools and technologies they use to help them build their mlops amazon senior data engineer christopher talucci said he often uses the python programming language and pycharm ide along with aws lambda kafka kinesis and redshift sarah nooravi a revenue strategy lead at snap inc uses airflow python git and bigquery machine learning matt weiss who is a data science manager at meta shared more holistic advice on building good mlops think of the whole process in mind think of the downstream user in mind weiss said think of what this model is going to be doing and how it will utilize its actionability in a business sense in a product sense the first half of the discussion concluded with panelists sharing some mistakes they made in the workplace and the lessons they learned from those mistakes weiss in particular talked about an instance in which he analyzed and interpreted data based on his own assumptions without consulting his colleagues if you are creating anything make sure to check against something that s already been solved said weiss don t make assumptions and find the source of truth if you re trying to re create something you may have some big things you missed career developmentnooravi detailed the challenges she experienced when transitioning to her first career after college at her first job noovari was the youngest and only female employee on her team and several of her colleagues had ph d degrees or had more work experience than her leading her to feel and be isolated and have imposter syndrome i had managers who were very supportive i had friends who were very supportive noovari said explaining that her support system helped her overcome difficulties at work she also highlighted the importance of diversity in the technology industry sharing a time when she was asked to speak on a panel at a conference that typically only invited male speakers the conference later developed an all woman panel peach then asked the panelists several questions about what they wished they had done early on in their career and to give the audience advice on how to succeed in new roles weiss said taking big swings by making high impact decisions is a powerful way to move forward and talucci suggested asking for help when you need it and documenting processes especially when you re new anywhere i do this every time i m new to a job being able to document all the processes that you re going through is always helpful talucci said giving examples such as tracking failures taking screenshots and more to put in your documentation level setting according to noovari is another important skill that helps when working in teams or with stakeholders what i tend to do is err on the side of over communicating noovari said which she explains is a good strategy when being given requests with unrealistic deadlines because stakeholders better understand where she is in the process and can shift their expectations it s when they don t know what s going on is when i think issues come up the last major question of the night was what hard or soft skills will help people level up in their career intellectual curiosity weiss said specifically in my world i look for who can take the question and build the biggest impact and influence with their insights someone who s willing to go the extra mile but be able to really formulate everything from start to finish so they can sell it noovari emphasized developing your communication skills noting that this is not limited to verbal communication like speaking up in meetings i have a lot of introverts on my team and i tell them if it s a zoom call just add things in the chat they can be really good at communication via email written communication can be very strong and offset them not speaking up in meetings noovari said so being an introvert isn t a bad thing it s actually just finding a medium in which you can exercise your skills karen phan student creativity and innovation take center stage at hack at uci 2023faculty spotlight veronica

veronica berrocal tried to convince herself that she did not want to follow in her father s footsteps and study statistics today that young girl from italy is a professor of statistics at uc irvine s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics she has been named a fellow of the american statistical association asa for research in spatial and spatio temporal statistics and applications to atmospheric and environmental sciences and environmental epidemiology she has served as chair of the section in environmental sciences envibayes of the international society of bayesian analysis isba and she has advised the environmental protection agency epa sharing her statistical expertise on scientific advisory panels learn here what finally drew her to the field after years of resistance and how she s now sharing her passion for statistics with others illustrating its impact and importance how did you first become interested in statistics my dad studied statistics but when i was younger i didn t want to do what my dad did when i was in high school and considering what to study at the university i was very undecided my mom suggested that i study math since i really liked it and math has a large number of applications i remember her mentioning atmospheric sciences and weather forecasting so i decided on math stayed clear of anything that had to do with probability or statistics and ended up specializing in differential geometry after getting my b s and m s degrees in math i came to the u s to michigan state university on a scholarship to do research as part of this research i had to learn genetics and how to model genetics data since i did not know statistics i had to take some classes but ones offered not by the department of statistics and probability but by the department of animal science where i was conducting my research i started to take these classes with the goal of developing a model to identify ways to maximize animal production although the statistical topics were interesting i was not really satisfied with the application and the focus on animal production so i decided to take classes from the department of statistics and probability and get a master s in statistics as i did that i got more and more into it and that s how i found myself wanting to go for a ph d so that s how it all started it s funny because i actually ended up following in my dad s footsteps can you talk about how your work blends the fields of statistics and environmental science the environment and environmental science were things i was always interested in even though i didn t grow up in a family of people who typically go hiking camping or anything like that i was interested in animals and i ve always wanted to advocate for the weaker links seeing animals get mistreated trees get cut down or a piece of land get urbanized has always made me sad so i ve always been interested in environmental conservation and when i applied to the ph d program at the university of washington i saw on the webpage of my advisor adrian raftery a project that excited me he wanted to estimate the size of the whale population specifically the bowhead whale the whaling commission needed to establish the quota of whales that could be hunted per year so they needed to have an idea of how many whales there were in the wild that s not easy to determine as one needs to estimate the size of the population based on what one sees occasionally when i went to visit the department though i was told that the funding for the project was over i still ended up going there for my ph d and working with adrian on a project related to atmospheric sciences and weather as my mom predicted years before from there i got interested in developing and applying statistical methods to answer questions in atmospheric sciences e g weather climate air pollution so i ve been interested in this particular area of science for a long time of course now with the threats connected to climate change becoming more and more evident people are very interested in environmental science research in connection to human health and sustainability as well what projects are you working on i ve spent a considerable amount of time working on projects related to air pollution that was something i started to work on during my postdoc and i m still working on it in fact i m collaborating with jun wu here at uci on a couple of projects that are focused on estimating air pollution levels in california and quantifying the effect of wildfires particularly on pregnant women i have also recently been invited to be part of an advisory panel that will be reviewing a tool the epa has developed called ejscreen the tool lets you map and compare exposure to various environmental risk factors across space air pollution is of course one of the environmental risk factors that poses a threat to human health more recently i ve become interested in climate change not only for its effects on human health or natural habitats but also in terms of agricultural production at this point despite the climate disinformation campaign i hope everybody understands that the climate is changing and that global warming is real for me even though i know that addressing climate change requires making country level political decisions across the globe especially by the countries that are the biggest polluters i realized that i want to contribute to research on climate change more on the front of mitigation what can we do to mitigate the effects of climate change you re also helping expose underrepresented minority middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science can you talk a bit about those efforts i ve been thinking about the issue of diversity in statistics for a long time in part because i am mixed race and i never completely felt at ease in certain environments so i always think about how it feels to be a student in a field where you don t see many other people like you or you don t recognize your experience in the experience of your peers the only way things can change is if we increase the number of students and faculty from diverse backgrounds there is a lot of effort in trying to recruit students into the graduate program but i think we need to start a little bit earlier for some disciplines it s easy for students to think i want to become a doctor or i want to be an engineer because people are familiar with these careers but if you re not around people who are familiar with the department of statistics or the school of ics you might not really know about data science as i was thinking about how we might reach middle or high school students i talked to joni ricks oddie director of uci s center for statistical consulting joni had a connection with uci s center for educational partnerships cfep and she introduced me to the group we did our first panel discussion together with high school students from orange county after that first event i did other presentations with cfep i really enjoy talking to these kids and hope they will consider going to college for data science and maybe even grad school but even just getting them into data science as an undergraduate is a win there needs to be more outreach to put statistics and data science on the map for people as i gave these presentations i realized that many high school students don t know what data science is or what type of jobs one could do with a degree in data science many high school students also don t know what a professor does besides teaching you also did a seminar series on data science careers correct two years ago i got an ics inspiration award and i organized a seminar series on career paths that was meant to help graduate students because of the pandemic the seminars were all hosted on zoom despite not being in person i managed to invite people from different sectors so that they could give graduate students an idea of the types of careers they could pursue after completing either their master s or ph d degree with the seminars i also wanted to help take away the anxiety that students often have of thinking i have to figure out my life completely once i get my degree or i m stuck in a certain career for the rest of my life i wanted students to know that there are many different paths that one can construct our first speaker violeta hennessey works at paramount pictures she got her ph d in biostatistics at md anderson and is now the director of paramount s digital archives and analytics another speaker luke bornn used to be the vice president of strategy and analytics for an nba team and now is co founder of a sports analytics company but he started as a professor we also had speakers in more traditional careers a data scientist who works at google a director of biostatistics within a pharmaceutical company a professor focused mostly on statistical education and a researcher who works in a government lab all the speakers talked about how they built their career and what types of problems or projects they typically work on students really liked it anyone interested in viewing the seminars can contact me how has public awareness around statistics changed since you first entered the field i can definitely say that even though i have only been a faculty member for 13 or 14 years i can see the impact of statistics on public discourse i remember when i was still an assistant professor at the university of michigan and i got invited as an ad hoc member to join advisory panels i would often be the only statistician on the panel the rest of the panel was composed of toxicologists and environmental health scientists now i get emails where the epa explicitly states that they are looking for people with biostatistics or statistics expertise to serve on this or that advisory panel and i think that s true for many other advisory panels more and more the importance of statistics is being recognized and statisticians are getting more involved in the public discourse i think this really speaks to the impact of statistics it s women s history month any women in stem trailblazers you want to spotlight keeping it close to the areas of statistics that i work in there are two women that i would like to highlight francesca dominici from harvard university was among the first statisticians to work on studies that assess the impact of air pollution on health using very large population level studies she has contributed to evidence on the adverse health effects of air pollution and her work continues to have enormous impact i really look up to her also anybody who works in bayesian statistics and spatial and environmental epidemiology knows sylvia richardson her work on bayesian computation mcmc and on spatial modeling are part of fundamental knowledge for anybody who works in spatial epidemiology from a bayesian perspective our own department of statistics also has two trailblazers jessica utts and annie qu jessica s impact on statistical education is long lasting thousands of students have learned statistics in their undergraduate classes using one of jessica s books and annie s research breadth and contribution to statistics are quite hard to match i don t think there are many statisticians who have never encountered her name on a statistical paper seen her name on the program of a statistical conference or seen her give a presentation so we don t have to go far to find inspiring women shani murray mds

emily truong moves to the rhythm of algorithms march 16 2023 as a dancer fourth year honors student emily truong has seen countless injuries around her she wanted to study dance and biology on a pre medicine track and become a doctor however after exploring the field of data science truong learned about the large scale impact she can make on the healthcare industry through data and was inspired to double major in dance and data science during my first year i took all these math classes and i was looking into which pathways use a lot of math says truong she also shadowed data scientists at a financial technology firm and self taught herself python the summer before college i thought data science could be an interesting pathway to go through so i started taking some data science classes and realized that i really liked it truong shared that her experience of touring uci was memorable and unique compared to other schools she toured which is one of the reasons she decided to attend uci one thing i remembered about uci was my campus tour guide said that uci was the first school to reverse boil an egg she says i thought uci was really pretty and calm truong is also minoring in bioinformatics and says research is a big part of her time at uci research is how she blends her passion for medicine with data since her second year truong has worked with health researchers as a research assistant in informatics professor kai zheng s lab she is also a student manager and supervises fellow student researchers in the lab she is especially proud of a yearlong study she worked on that examined pre and post covid 19 opioid overdoses which will be published and presented in april at the uc real world evidence conference currently truong is working with uci health s all of us database to gather information on patient recruitment in clinical trials join clubs and organizations a lot of research positions are passed down that way networking is also really important she says adding that contacting professors directly and reading emails from the ics student affairs office are other ways to find openings in research labs outside of her data science classes and research at uci truong is part of the engineering fraternity theta tau where she created a gesture controlled automated curtain with her fraternity brothers this past summer she interned at kaiser permanente and worked with data on hypertension heart attack and stroke outcomes and suicide prevention truong has spent the second half of her college career focused on research and learning more about data science to prepare herself for a career in data science her double major in dance and data science helps her balance the stress and demands of her math and computer science classes because she enjoys the creativity stimulation and exercise in her dance classes after i come out of computer science class i m like oh i m so tired but after i go to dance class it boosts my energy says truong it s a really nice balance when she graduates truong hopes to continue dancing recreationally many of the soft skills she applies to her research and internship experience in data science come from dancing which she has been doing since she was 5 years old she says her work ethic time management and planning skills and creativity all come from dancing one of emily s hobbies is crocheting her latest creation is this frog with a busy school schedule truong turns to a few activities and hobbies to de stress she is part of a dance team on campus called project renegade and the sorority tri delta and enjoys attending dance performances on campus to support her peers she also likes to spend time with her friends and crochet her most recent creation is a frog truong is interested in careers in data science that will allow her to influence people and improve lives at scale her internship at kaiser permanente has also inspired her to pursue a graduate degree in data science and a role in predictive analysis one of the things that brought me into data science was realizing that i could do a lot of work behind the scenes and actually impact a lot of people at once she says karen phan faculty

inaugural datathon would not have been possible without the dedication and marketing efforts of their board members and interns since this is our first datathon we had to essentially start from scratch says yee one of the biggest challenges was securing data challenges and funding for our event we ve sent hundreds of emails and linkedin messages to different companies and organizations with a dozen at most responding back we were very glad of the sponsors and funding we were able to receive according to data uci president and third year data science major william hou the club s hard work paid off the datathon exceeded hou s expectations before it officially began our team has never put on an event like this before so there was a lot of uncertainty especially when we first started planning around whether people would actually sign up says hou we ended up not only meeting our attendance goal but actually having to waitlist some of our applicants due to capacity limitations hou also expresses excitement about successfully putting a data related spin on traditional software hackathons adding that data uci plans to host a bigger and better datathon next year data uci hopes to build a strong reputation for its collegiate datathon in the years to come in the meantime hou and yee encourage students to continue participating in datathons you have the opportunity to work in a

establish a data science major uc irvine has been an educational leader in this growing field for close to a decade in addition to launching the major in 2015 uci recently started hosting summer programs for both high school and undergraduate students interested in data analytics and biostatistics and its socal data science program helps recruit train and dispatch a diverse workforce of stem and data science majors now the socal data science program is scaling up thanks to a 1 3 million pathways development grant from the california education learning lab the socal data science programthe socal data science program kicked off in 2022 with a three year 1 5 million grant from the national science foundation the program is a collaborative effort between faculty from uci california state university fullerton csuf and cypress college and the inaugural cohort of 32 fellows drawn from all three campuses attended a one week training bootcamp and conducted a six week research project at uci last summer professor babak shahbaba with the program welcoming 30 new fellows later this month statistics professor babak shahbaba of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics is already looking to the future as we are working with this new cohort finishing the second year we re thinking about continuity and sustainability says shahbaba the program lead at uci we don t want the program and the benefit that it provides to end when the nsf grant ends the new four year pathways development grant guarantees that the benefits will continue creating a pipeline of talentthe grant proposal titled pipe line programs for institutional pathway engagement accelerating infrastructure and education outlines ways to develop pathways and overcome equity gaps in data science learning csuf will serve as the host organization with professor jessica jaynes as project lead partnering closely with faculty from uci riverside city college rcc and rio hondo college rhc this grant will help us continue and expand our activities around data science education at the undergraduate level says shahbaba and this actually goes beyond the students it includes developing training materials and hosting workshops for instructors to build the required infrastructure the socal data science program aligns perfectly with the california learning lab s grand challenge on building critical mass for data science the learning lab wanted to establish this relationship between different tiers of academic institutes in california and we were already doing that with a uc cal state and community college says shahbaba the pipe line proposal has three overarching goals create pathways in data science between the three institutional tiers by establishing new courses and programs address equity gaps in data science education by expanding access to technology resources incorporating culturally relevant pedagogy and applying a content with context approach and support a diverse group of faculty and students in data science resulting in a robust community of data science learners the proposal doesn t extend the number of fellows 120 expected to be funded with the nsf grant rather it helps ensure other students have access to the same type of data science education outside of the program it s more about building the infrastructure to replicate the training that we ve been providing to these fellows and to scale it up says shahbaba as part of this work ics will host training workshops and an annual data science education conference helping instructors establish data science courses at community colleges and building a strong sense of community and at cal state fullerton adds shahbaba we will look into setting up a data science major and minor this creates a pipeline of talent for not only industry but for graduate programs as well we provide this program to help the students but also it helps uci in a way explains shahbaba two of the fellows from cal state fullerton in last year s cohort were among the 11 students accepted into uci s statistics ph d program this year so it s a two way gateway we transfer the knowledge and experience that we have developed over many years and in return we re recruiting these highly diverse skilled and motivated students pipe line thus aims to arm the next generation of data scientists with the knowledge and tools needed to tackle tomorrow s biggest challenges students well trained in data science at the undergraduate level strengthen data analytics in all industries from healthcare to transportation and support graduate level statistical research that will advance our understanding of issues ranging from disease prevention to climate change leading to novel solutions shani murray ics and engineering

least of the 11 ceremonies said dean marios c papaefthymiou in his welcoming remarks to the crowd of students families and friends and esteemed faculty students at the 2023 ics commencement ceremony this celebration of the roughly 815 undergraduate degrees 160 graduate degrees and 275 professional masters degrees that ics expects to confer this year began with an inspiring rendition of the national anthem performed by aerodynamix an a capella group of uci students the class of 2023 heard from classmate nadia etemadi who spoke of her journey to becoming a software developer and from featured speaker julia white chief marketing and solutions officer at the enterprise software company sap who offered words of wisdom from her nearly 30 years in the tech industry first however provost and executive vice chancellor hal stern congratulated the students the students that we re celebrating especially many of the undergraduates had a remarkable educational experience he noted impacted by a global pandemic that changed the world in ways that nobody could have imagined he commended the students for their ability to maintain their focus on projects problem sets labs and reports and for their personal growth you ve been challenged in classes and in your conversations with your friends to accept understand and challenge different points of view said stern highlighting a core element of the college experience society needs more people with the ability to listen to give people the benefit of the doubt and to engage in civil conversation with those with whom we disagree emphasizing that commencement marks a new beginning stern challenged the students to do all the little things you can to make the world a better place and to find your passion and pursue it building on communities of supportdean marios then introduced etemadi an iranian american graduating with her master s degree in software engineering as etemadi took the stage she transported the audience back in time imagine for a moment that it s the year 2013 she started i was a nervous wreck of a 14 year old sitting in my counselor s office in selecting the last elective for her first year of high school she had to choose between woodshop or intro to computer programming she remembered calling her mom for advice ever the cautious parent she suggested computer programming i can t exactly chop my arm off with a keyboard and mouse said etemadi laughing that one decision ended up cultivating a love of programming within me she said dragging and dropping code blocks in scratch might have just been another elective course for some kids but for me it was a window into a whole new world after high school etemadi s dreams of attending an elite college came crashing down when she was rejected everywhere she applied so she found another path she attended west valley community college where she found a community of incredibly talented compassionate professors and students she went on to study computer science at uc davis where she again found a community of supportive classmates the culmination of which was a zoom graduation in her living room as a graduate student at uci her initial online connections flourished with the return to on campus learning and she collaborated with fellow graduate students and research lab members with help from her advisor andre van der hoek she developed a prototype tool that lets people edit videos to attach to bug reports now as she prepares to find a job as a software developer she looks forward to meeting yet another community of talented and supportive peers and colleagues she wishes the same for her fellow graduates advising the class of 2023 to carve out a space for themselves that builds on their unique experiences memories and communities from uci student speaker nadia etemadi and her advisor informatics professor andre van der hoek finding the constant in an ever changing worldwhite who earned her b a from stanford university and mba from harvard and who spent 20 years at microsoft before joining sap acknowledged that commencement speakers often talk of unprecedented times yet for this class of 2023 she stressed that these times are truly unprecedented she talked not only of the start of their college journey and the resilience required during the global pandemic but also of the end of their journey as they enter the workforce at the dawn of the next massive revolution in technology with artificial intelligence she assured the students that armed with a world class education they are well prepared for the challenges and opportunities that await them the bren school has prepared you with the latest technology skills the ability to think critically and hands on experiences at some of the most innovative organizations in the world she also spoke to the first generation college students who made up nearly half of the graduating class you re creating a new legacy for your family and community which is remarkable she went on to share what she has learned from her nearly 30 years of working in technology which started with launching online banking at intuit technology is always advancing but there s no technology advancement without people she compared today s angst about ai s impact on jobs to what she saw back in 2007 with the cloud revolution as she helped move companies away from their server rooms to cloud based services she recognized the importance of retraining it professionals providing opportunities for career advancement as well as for further cloud innovation humanity needs to be at the center of everything we do in technology stressed white we re so lucky to have the skills the know how to help the world run better through technology it s an awesome opportunity and a massive responsibility calling on the class of 2023 to act as values based tech minded leaders she acknowledged that it s a tumultuous time do not lose hope because today every company is a tech company retailers manufactures banks automotive companies nonprofit governments all of them are in dire need of your skills every company now competes and differentiates with technology she also acknowledged the power of ai but insisted it s still just a tool one that you will be at the forefront of guiding and harnessing she then implored the next generation of tech leaders to use their knowledge and skills to improve society prioritizing responsible and ethical development tech will always advance let your values and ethics be the constant in an ever changing world featured commencement speaker julia white of sap the strongest anteater zot to conclude the ceremony dean marios asked all of the family and friends to stand as he recognized their support in

outside the box when it comes to providing the technical expertise and skillsets students need for success says ics director of corporate relations jason king and we could not do this without our industry partners who offer unique opportunities for professional development and mentorship the capstone experiencethe projects on display were completed for undergraduate capstone courses in informatics computer science and game design for the ics honors program and for the butterworth product development competition these programs benefit not only students who gain opportunities for practical application and important soft skills but also benefit program sponsors who gain opportunities for recruitment and support for under resourced projects once again there was a wide range in the diversity of projects covering domains ranging from web development and social media to ai and machine learning to all the hot topics of the day says informatics professor hadar ziv who taught the first informatics capstone course in ics back in 2009 in fact two of the three winning projects for informatics were in the medical field with a direct impact on society these projects were beatingmelanoma com sponsored by hoag and memory air which enhances memory recall through the sense of smell there were also novel games on display in game design we talk a lot about polish making those small adjustments that take a game from good to great capstone is the class where they get to see a project all the way through says informatics professor kurt squire who led the capstone projects for the game design and interactive media major the students work closely with industry mentors who can point them to resources and processes that go beyond what any one faculty can do alone computer science professor sergio gago masague who leads the capstone course for the department of computer science also highlights the benefits for students the program gives students the opportunity to apply their computer science skills and knowledge to real world problems and to closely work with industry partners to develop innovative solutions he says it is a great opportunity to learn and grow and the ics project expo really is the culmination of these efforts bringing all the program parties together and rewarding everyone s good work especially the students with more than 300 attendees including students and faculty project and corporate partners and alumni the event excelled in uniting a variety of industry and academic stakeholders award winning projectsnew to the ics project expo this year was the chance for each team to win up to 2 300 for the top awards a group of industry leaders ics alumni and faculty used the rocketjudge app to score all of the projects with

management navigate team dynamics manage delivery deadlines develop solutions for real life business problems and most of all practice and hone presentation skills i am very excited to see the capstone program grow and evolve and hope a variety of companies leverage project sponsorship as a tool for recruitment and engagement developing a tech talent pipelineanother expo attendee mark percy president of the ceo leadership alliance of orange county claoc also hopes to encourage more corporate sponsorships with ceo members representing a good cross section of large medium and small employers in the region claoc is working to grow oc into a tech talent hub i was incredibly impressed and found the program introductions valuable to understand the breadth and depth of talent within ics says percy the students were super sharp and the ones i spoke to were very articulate explaining their projects this piqued his interest in potential collaborations i hope to encourage more of our members to undertake future projects and mentor the ics students he says he similarly hopes to encourage ics students to look for job opportunities in orange county all of our claoc members want to invest in local talent and most are developing a tech talent pipeline right here the ics project expo highlights how uci is instrumental in supporting that pipeline and keeping local companies on the cutting edge of technological advances the ics capstone program is only growing says ziv the future trajectory is exciting if you are a company interested in sponsoring a capstone project contact mimi

instructors from all around the country arrived at uc irvine for a weeklong boot camp aimed at advancing bayesian thinking in stem bats nancy elizabeth wentzel of tennessee an assistant math professor at northeast state community college was among the bats attendees i ve told my students before that the computational power we have now has revolutionized the way we re able to approach statistical problems says wentzel who teaches an introductory course in statistics however prior to attending the bats boot camp she had only a vague understanding of bayesian statistics and the real world problems it can address having almost no experience working with realistically large data sets statistical modeling programming bayesian inference or analysis of results i ve now seen examples of all of these and been able to follow along with the big picture of what bayesian methods look like in different contexts says wentzel this will enable me to speak with more knowledge and conviction about the importance of bayesian methods to accomplish incredibly meaningful real world progress on the problems that matter most to all of us in healthcare technology and every other area of modern life bats program directors and boot camp attendees the need for new trainingthe wide range of applications for bayesian statistics from supply chain management to climate change adaptation was part of the motivation for creating the bats program there is such a need for this kind of training says statistics professor mine dogucu of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics dogucu is leading the bats program in collaboration with jingchen monika hu of vassar college and amy herring of duke university the program stems from a paper dogucu and hu wrote last year the current state of undergraduate bayesian education and recommendations for the future as outlined in the paper their review of 150 colleges across the u s revealed that only 46 offered a bayesian course and in all but four it was an elective not required course uci was one of only four that required the course for its data science major says dogucu based on the findings and with funding from a national science foundation nsf program aimed at improving undergraduate stem education dogucu hu and herring designed a program to broaden the reach of bayesian learning through instructor training we have a lot of programs designed for students says dogucu but there s very very few opportunities for faculty training after people get their ph d advancing bayesian thinking in stembats is a three tiered program for training stem instructors and for developing and disseminating learning materials that highlight the use of bayesian methods in stem fields program participants receive a stipend helping cover their time and expenses tier one of the program is the summer boot camp offered at uci this summer and on the east coast at vassar college in summer 2024 uci s boot camp attendees came from both two and four year institutions and from a variety of departments including math economics biology and public policy the weeklong program included daily lessons on bayesian inference computing and modeling put together by dogucu hu and herring ics ph d student federica zoe ricci also supported the program as a graduate student researcher tier two of the program will take place this fall with 10 instructors selected from the boot camp to develop bayesian teaching and learning materials using scientific data from their fields dogucu hu and herring will mentor the instructors and help guide curriculum development tier three will then involve having five of those 10 instructors showcase the materials at conferences and through open access publications in tier one they learn about basic statistics and in tier two we want to see how this can directly impact student outcomes with new teaching materials explains dogucu then in tier three we want this impact to reach a national audience with published papers and presentations at conferences the ultimate goal is to strengthen undergraduate level statistics education for improved scientific outcomes most importantly there are two big paradigms to approaching statistics frequentist which comes with p values and bayesian says dogucu moving forward it would be very good if instructors knew both of these methods well

august 10 2023 did people enjoy the movie spider man no way home how did fans react to delays in releasing the sequel to hollow knight how did red states versus blue states view the 2020 election did the release of valorant increase its popularity and what about the popularity of high school football these are the questions 10 high school students in teams of two chose to explore during a new data science for all summer program held at uc irvine from july 10 21 2023 the students analyzed related tweets using texera an open source platform for collaborative data analytics the platform is being developed by professor chen li of the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics who led the summer program in collaboration with professor wei wang of ucla thanks to funding through the national science foundation s broadening participation in computing bpc program the two week summer camp which ran from 9 a m 4 p m on weekdays and included lunch was free to attend instructors included both uci and ucla professors and ph d students with expertise in data management data science and machine learning the goal was to leverage the texera platform in teaching students particularly those with a limited background in computing data science and machine learning techniques including basic concepts about data wrangling ml training data classification sentiment analysis and visualization one of the high school students lesley gomez says that participating in the program has inspired her to delve deeper into data science the interactive lectures and completing labs through the texera platform helped me gain a deeper understanding of data science additionally this program gave me the opportunity to enhance several essential skills including public speaking as we got to deliver presentations to high school students the creators of texera and parents she says overall the ds4all program was a great experience for me high school students in uci ics shirts with their instructors for the data science 4 all program teaching with texerathe first week li and xiaozhen liu a computer science ph d student at uci taught the students about big data preparation discussing topics such data modeling databases data cleaning data wrangling and visualization the second week ucla instructors gave lectures on machine learning ai and natural language processing throughout the program students attended lab sessions and gained hands on experience using texera for the capstone project students selected their own topic for sentiment analysis we gave them the raw tweets and they spent the first week cleaning the data says liu then they did the analysis during the second week using machine learning models on these tweets to gain some insights high school students zeina harden and vitoria mendez building a texera workflow together to analyze tweets about high school football left and discussing their workflow during their final presentation right it s amazing that these students despite their various backgrounds within one day were able to become familiar with texera and then use the system to do data wrangling and data preparation steps says li we were pretty happy to see the students learn how to use the system so quickly aside from its user friendly gui another benefit of texera is that you don t have to install any compute intensive software everything happens on the server side so you can even use an old laptop that is cheap and not very powerful says li during the program uci provided students with mac laptops and they didn t need to always have the same laptop they just needed to go to the website and log in that s the beauty of the cloud service chris rodas and lesley gomez give their presentation on their analysis of spider man no way home tweets talking about how they used logistic regression training what s nextthe program was a win win for students and faculty alike a benefit to us is the students were using our servers so they gave us a lot of good feedback about texera s usability scalability and efficiency says li which is also beneficial to our research the nsf funding for the project is for two years so li plans to host the program again next summer hopefully doubling the number of attendees to 20 he is also exploring other ways to leverage texera to introduce students to data science we need to think about how to repeat this program in a more systematic way he says summer is good because most students have free time but how else might we broaden participation the team is considering other ways to leverage texera in introducing data science to high school students or to undergraduate students who aren t majoring in a stem field we plan to organize all our materials for not only the same program next year but also possibly for some other programs says li our platform is especially useful for people who have a limited it background that s the sweet spot for us because of texera s cloud model and user friendly interface so we re pretty happy with how the program turned out shani murray summer school for stem faculty a boot camp in bayesian thinkingmandt appointed program chair for aistats

the flamingo project on data cleaning the flamingo project on data cleaning department of computer science uc irvine objective the flamingo project focuses on data cleaning i e how to deal with errors and inconsistencies in information systems as an example in many applications such as data integration commercial organizations need to collect data from various sources to conduct analysis and make decisions often the data from these different sources can have inconsistencies for instance we use first name last name ssn and birthday to identify a person however the same name e g schwarzenegger may be misspelled as swarzzengaer or other forms such errors make it more challenging to link records from different places and answer queries approximately we are developing algorithms in order to make query answering and information retrieval efficient in the presence of such inconsistencies and errors with the nsf award iis 0844574 we plan to study the following problems supporting fuzzy queries is becoming increasingly more important in applications that need to deal with a variety of data inconsistencies in structures representations or semantics many existing algorithms require an offline analysis of data sets to construct an efficient index structure to support online query processing fuzzy join queries of data sets are more time consuming due to the computational complexity the pi is studying three research problems 1 constructing high quality inverted lists for fuzzy search queries using hadoop 2 supporting fuzzy joins of large data sets using hadoop and 3 using the developed techniques to improve data quality of large collections of documents with the nsf award 1030002 we will study how to support powerful keyword search with efficient indexing structures and algorithms in a clouding computing infrastructure a main application is supporting family reunification in disasters such as the haiti earthquake check our portals for the haiti earthquake and chile earthquake the main challenge is how to use limited programming primitives in the cloud to implement index structures and search algorithms our qspeller project page for the microsoft speller

alsubaiee ph d student alexander behm ph d student shengyue ji ph d student liang jin graduated from uc irvine in 2005 chen li faculty jiaheng lu postdoc 2006 2008 now a faculty at renmin university china yiming lu graduated from uc irvine in 2008 rares vernica ph d student back to flamingo main page getting started please refer to the flamingo getting started guide introduction this release in c includes the source code of several algorithms for approximate string matching developed at uc irvine it includes algorithms for approximate selection queries location based approximate keyword search selectivity estimation for approximate selection queries approximate queries on mixed types and others although an implementation for approximate joins is included the focus of this release is on approximate selection queries here is a brief explanation of the terms used above approximate string search given a collection of strings and a single string how to find those strings in the collection that are similar to the given string this functionality is implemented by the modules common filtertree listmerger stringmap and partenum we recommend getting started with the filtertree module for this purpose selectivity estimation for approximate string search given a collection of strings and a single string how can we estimate the number of strings that are similar to the given string this functionality is implemented in the sepia module approximate string join given two collections of strings possibly the same collection how to find those pairs of strings that are similar to each other location based approximate keyword search given a collection of spatial objects with descriptive keywords find those objects within a given spatial region that have a given set of keywords in addition the keywords don t need to match exactly but approximately this functionality is implemented by the module lbak tree there are various string similarity functions such as levenshtein distance aka the edit distance jaccard similarity cosine similarity and dice similarity the following is a description of the modules corresponding to the source directory structure common this module contains classes for supporting the following similarity functions distance measures levenshtein distance aka edit distance jaccard similarity cosine similarity dice similarity it also provides functionality for decomposing strings into grams filtertree this module provides functionality for approximate string search using an inverted list index furthermore query performance can be improved by adding filters i e partitioning the string collection into disjoint subsets according to some property e g the length of the strings the use of filters is facilitated by a hierarchical structure the filtertree in which each level in the tree corresponds to one filter we have implemented the length and charsum filter this package contains three flavors of indexes in memory indexes compressed uncompressed and a disk based index listmerger answering approximate string queries based on an inverted list index requires finding elements that occur at least t times on the inverted lists belonging to the grams in the query string t depends on the similarity metric and the similarity threshold this problem is commonly referred to as the t occurrence problem this module implements several algorithms for solving the t occurrence problem as described in efficient merging and filtering algorithms for approximate string searches chen li jiaheng lu and yiming lu icde 2008 in addition we have implemented efficient algorithms for disk based indexes mat tree mat tree is an indexing structure to support queries on data with an approximate string predicate and a numeric predicate a typical query is find employee records whose name is similar to speilberg and whose age is close to 45 the indexing structure is proposed in the following paper indexing mixed types for approximate retrieval liang jin nick koudas chen li anthony k h tung vldb 2005 trondheim norway sepia this technique solves the problem of estimating the selectivity of an approximate string predicate it can answer questions such as from a collection of strings how many of them have an edit distance within 3 to a given string such information can be used in optimizing queries of approximate string matching the technique was published in the paper selectivity estimation for fuzzy string predicates in large data sets liang jin and chen li vldb 2005 trondheim norway stringmap this algorithm maps strings from the edit distance metric space to a high dimensional euclidean space and uses a multi dimensional indexing structure to answer approximate queries the algorithm is published in the paper efficient record linkage in large data sets by liang jin chen li and sharad mehrotra in 8th international conference on database systems for advanced applications dasfaa 2003 kyoto japan partenum this algorithm is published in the paper efficient exact set similarity joins arvind arasu venkatesh ganti raghav kaushik vldb 2006 we implemented the algorithm to support approximate string matching queries excluding approximate joins topk this package contains algorithms for efficient top k approximate string search lbak tree this module implements location based approximate keyword search as described in supporting location based approximate keyword search by sattam alsubaiee alexander behm and chen li it enhances an r tree with inverted indexes for approximate selection queries it implements various algorithms for choosing r tree nodes to place inverted indexes in the filtertree module is used to provide the inverted indexes for approximate selection queries in addition we have provided some commonly used functions in the util directory changes in version 4 1 compared to version 4 0 added support for damerau levenshtein distance edit distance also allowing swapping of two adjacent characters compilation warning fixes for osx submitted by jim apple from on time systems thanks a lot jim fixed 64 bit issues in lbak tree bibtex misc misc flamingo4 1 2010 author alexander

inclusion of types in dbmss postgres paper introduction slides march 31st april 5th data models query languages temporal data the concept of time is critical in almost all database applications after all databases store the entities in the physical world which is constantly evolving yet basic sql does not include any specific ways of querying over time ideally we would like to be able to be able to query to be run on any snapshot of time not just the current time e g we should be able to ask a query what was the average age of employees at uci last year and not just what is the average age of the employees at uci which is essentially interpreted as a query on the database state right now after all the database has associated with it a concept of a log which stores the whole history of the evolution of the data so logically we should be able to query the database for any instance of time these set of papers will highlight some of the finest progress and ideas in thinking reasoning and support the notion of time in databases we will explore query languages data models representation and also look at some of the implication of representing time in databases the papers we will read

14th representing managing streaming data streaming data management systems change the traditional paradigm of data management wherein data is mostly static and queries dynamically arrive in streaming data systems the queries are expected to be static also known as continuous queries and data arrives dynamically streaming data is not a new concept e g pub sub systems and event processing systems of the past and present have similar characteristics many of the technologies query languages processing mechanisms etc can and have been borrowed in building stream management systems stream data management systems extend the above work in variety of ways more complex query languages which are more expressive compared to say languages supported by pub sub systems new processing optimization techniques new approaches to load management e g load shedding as a mechanism to achieve cost versus quality tradeoff approximation as a mechanism to achieve scalability etc most work on stream data management has been driven from applications such as network monitoring complex analysis on event oriented information and continuous monitoring in adhoc sensor networks in the context of sensor data additional design constraints of sensor battery preservation has also been extensively studied techniques such as cost quality tradeoffs and in network processing of queries have been explored our goal in this class is to explore the area of stream data management from the perspective of data model and query languages specifically what types of queries are important over streaming data and how

cypress home people publications events videos and demos for members cypress dependability techniques for instrumented cyber physical spaces the cypress cyber physical resilliance and sustainability project explores techniques for dependability resilience and sustainability in cyberphysical spaces the project derives its name from the cypress tree that represents durability and sustainability advances in sensing embedded computing and communication technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to add intelligence into physical systems and enable the creation of instrumented cyber physical spaces icpss example critical infrastructures include airports energy distribution networks and organizations such as schools and hospitals example critical applications range from surveillance to security and situation aware emergency response for icpss to transform our lives through new functionality robustness and efficiency they must provide dependable infrastructure components in the presence of failures and disruptions and generate dependable information in the face of errors in sensing communications and computations dynamic adaptability of large icpss that employ heterogeneous sensing and actuation technologies becomes the fundamental enabler for dependable icpss dependability as defined by the ifip 10 4 working group on dependable computing and fault tolerance refers to the trustworthiness of computing systems that allows reliance to be justifiably placed on the services it delivers dependability constitutes a variety of non functional requirements including availability reliability maintainability safety and integrity in the context of icps dependability can broadly be classified at two interdependent levels that combined can provide a trustworthy platform for building applications infrastructure dependability how dependable are the underlying infrastructure components e g sensors networks actuators computing storage elements software environments in the presence of diverse failures that may lead to disruptions and information dependability how dependable is the information generated by the underlying infrastructure given errors uncertainty in sensor readings and data analysis mechanisms in this project we are expoiting an observe analyze adapt oaa architecture in which an icps has a model of itself its objectives and its effects on the environment the icps achieves dependability objectives through adaptation using runtime application of formal analysis methods the proposed dependability techniques are cross layer in nature and range from combining multiple networking and messaging technologies to adaptive sensing and information fusion figure 1 illustrates our approach to designing icps management software using oaa approach where a self observing introspecting system will initiate a logical adaptation of its components to meet dependability needs icps systems and devices designed using a cross layer architecture supply dynamic streams of information that are used by application which in turn adapt the usage and execution of the infrastructure since icps systems are dynamic observation and monitoring of a system and its evolution is critical to enabling dependability at the heart of the system is the icps statedb that implements the observe aspect of the oaa cycle a formal modeling and reasoning component allows for concrete specification of the icps system and analyzes the current system state to reason about the dependability properties providing a limited but focused analyze component in the oaa cycle the outcome of the analysis will help us generate adaptations that comply with dependability constraints the adaptation component makes changes to deal with dynamics in the environment implements human driven changes by embedding human activities and human in the loop decisions and deploys the logical adaptations into the physical icps infrastructure a key feature of our approach see right side of figure 2 is the ability to perform cross layer analysis and adaptation both vertically i e across abstraction layers ranging from the application to middleware os and hardware and horizontally across geographically distributed components interconnected via multiple heterogeneous networks thus oaa at the infrastructure level enables stability of the entire operational infrastructure the proposed effort focuses on system level techniques for dependable cps operation human interactions occur via applications that specify their dependability needs there are four main research tasks included in our project 1 dependable cross layer observation and state management 2 formal methods for cps system dependability analysis 3 adaptations to support infrastructure dependability 4 adaptations to support information dependability research task 1 corresponds to the observe step in oaa in this task we will generate a cross layer specification of the underlying system its abilities and application dependability needs using quantitative and qualitative analysis and design an icps state capture service for the analyze step we use lightweight formal methods to analyze the current state of the system given an infrastructure and application to determine violations of dependability needs task 2 finally the adapt step is investigated in research tasks 3 and 4 where adaptations are designed to enhance infrastructure and information dependability we aim to develop 1 an array of specific cross layer adaptation techniques to support infrastructure and information dependability in icpss using the oaa paradigm 2 a formal modeling framework supporting executable formal models to maintain runtime system models and formal analysis techniques to guide the adaptation process and 3 the incorporation of 1 and 2 into middleware services that provide dependability aware icps state management and adaptation responsphere i sensorium

recent news news virtual disaster cities to provide real life resilience virtual disaster cities to provide real life resilience september 16 2024 share this share on facebookshare on twittershare on linkedinshare through emailcopy permalink after a massive earthquake struck japan on march 11 2011 teachers at ukedo elementary school ordered a swift evacuation to higher ground saving the entire student body from the deadly tsunami that followed tragically students at okawa elementary school remained in the schoolyard instead of moving to a nearby hillside resulting in the loss of 74 students and 10 teachers given the enormous impact of such split second decisions how can we better prepare people to make informed choices when facing an impending disaster computer science professor nalini venkatasubramanian is exploring this question through a partnership between uc irvine and tohoku university in japan after going through the 2011 earthquake and tsunami researchers at tohoku started conducting tsunami inundation modeling so they have a huge amount of expertise in this type of planning says venkatasubramanian she and a team of researchers in uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics have their own expertise in leveraging data gathered through the internet of things iot to help protect vulnerable communities particularly older adults now the two groups of researchers are collaborating on a three year 1m grant funded through the national science foundation nsf and japan science and technology jst agency the joint nsf jst project enabling human centered digital twins for community resilience aims to apply the concept of digital twins to disaster science better analyzing the impact of natural disasters on humans and outlining real time pathways to safety protecting older adults the situation becomes even more dire when it comes to populations with specialized needs like older adults or people with disabilities says venkatasubramanian so we re focusing on leveraging data from these digital twins to reduce the vulnerabilities of older adults during a natural disaster the u s team includes computer science professor sharad mehrotra and other ics faculty remote sensing and geographic information system gis experts from boston university and experts from imagecat inc a risk management innovation company in long beach the researchers are also engaging with julie rousseau and lisa gibbs geriatric medical experts from the uci school of medicine and nursing with medical multi complexity older adults face higher morbidity and mortality during disasters around the world says rousseau with rapidly rising 65 populations japan and the u s need innovative solutions to build equitable disaster resilience for vulnerable older adults with physical and or cognitive disabilities the project involves designing tools to create disaster digital twin ddt cities that are representative of sendai in japan and southern california in the u s these cyberworld replicas will highlight both what these communities have in common as well as certain differences while southern california has a lot of continuing care facilities housing larger groups of older adults together the community structure is very different in japan where older adults are oftentimes more integrated into the general community living independently says venkatasubramanian also southern california is more likely to experience a wildfire than a tsunami these types of differences will be considered during crisis modeling building human centered digital twins researchers usually predict a disaster s impact in a very mathematical sense says venkatasubramanian for example she says they might provide a mathematical modeling of a tsunami s inundation levels indicative of the height and speed of the incoming water flow but then how she asks do we assess the impact on the broader community the goal is to create a virtual disaster city that can not only map out the effects of a disaster but also analyze the impact on specific structures and the people within those structures including data on their health and mobility needs as we saw at ukedo elementary school everyone there could move to higher ground for safety explains venkatasubramanian but what if a main bridge had collapsed what if you were home alone in a wheelchair what if you were in a skilled nursing facility hooked up to a ventilator these are the kinds of questions our virtual cities hope to answer the team is working with japanese and california agencies with expertise in disaster resilience and aging populations such as the international research institute on disaster services irides in japan stakeholder workshops will enable the team to understand the older adult disaster landscape leading to research that integrates diverse geospatial and human centric data sources into a novel information architecture to enrich and align multiresolution spatiotemporal data executes physics driven hazard simulations and simulates disaster processes and consequences in virtual disaster cities focusing on an older population modeling communities and their interactions and needs as a digital twin for disaster response is a critical application with transformative impact for social good says mehrotra such modeling will include dealing with data incompleteness and uncertainty finding methods for timely data collection and planning and centering the required human elements advancing ditial twin technology in new and important directions furthermore the team will build on lessons learned from the caredex project another effort venkatasubramanian is leading caredex is a smart space platform for securely exchanging customized care information between first responders caregivers in senior housing facilities and older adults exploring interdisciplinary data driven solutions venkatasubramanian says that the larger goal of the digital twins project is to bring together a variety of stakeholders in exploring data driven solutions you have geologists tsunami experts engineers ai specialists and computer scientists professional caregivers government officials she says all looking at the sociological and societal contexts as we explore ways to build better technology solutions she touched on this effort in february when giving a keynote talk in sendai for the international conference on big data for disaster response and management in asia and the pacific sponsored by the asian development bank which invests in building climate resilience across more than 30 countries the talk focused on emerging technologies for enabling resilient cyber human infrastructure nalini venkatasubramanian third from left outside the international research institute on disaster services irides building while attending the international conference on big data for disaster response and management in asia and the pacific such infrastructure could support a variety of populations across the globe experiencing a range of disasters from floods to wildfires although the digital twins project is looking at a very specific context we re also considering what solutions translate across the international community and plan to expand our findings more globally says venkatasubramanian we need to understand the structure of the community and its policies to simulate a variety of different scenarios to help people better prepare shani murray categories academicscomputer sciencenewsresearch tags digital twindisaster digital twindisaster sciencenalini

design it is critical to understand how the intervention effect varies over time and with contextual information this study aims to assess how a push noti cation suggesting physical activity in uences individuals step counts using data from the heartsteps micro randomized trial mrt the statistical challenges include the time varying treatments and longitudinal functional step count measurements we propose the rst semiparametric causal excursion effect model with varying coef cients to model the time varying effects within a decision point and across decision points in an mrt the proposed model incorporates double time indices to accommodate the longitudinal functional outcome enabling the assessment of time varying effect moderation by contextual variables we propose a two stage causal effect estimator that is robust against a misspeci ed high dimensional outcome regression nuisance model we establish asymptotic theory and conduct simulation studies to validate the proposed estimator our analysis provides new insights into individuals change in response pro les such as how soon a response occurs due to the activity suggestions how such changes differ by the type of

glassdoor s list of the 50 best jobs in american for 2020 which shouldn t be too surprising given the rise of big data and growing demand for empirical based decision making across many industries to help meet this demand the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics is currently accepting applications for the new master of data science mds program it is launching in the fall of 2021 anyone interested in joining the inaugural cohort of this 15 month professional graduate program can apply online the early application deadline is december 15th 2020 after that applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until april 15th 2021 we see lots of demand coming from individuals who were trained in computer science for example without rigorous statistical training says daniel gillen chair of the department of statistics we also see demand coming from individuals who were trained in mathematical sciences and statistics but don t have the computing background he continues and then there are a lot of individuals coming from other disciplines as well from business analytics backgrounds and from political and social science backgrounds so whether you re in the tech industry at a financial institution in a domain such as education or healthcare or a recent graduate looking for more training this program is designed to advance your data science skills while there are minimum course requirements the goal is to fill certain gaps in training while providing practical hands on experience what makes this program unique is that it is going to be taught and delivered by world renowned experts in the foundations of data science meaning both statistics and computing says gillen the courses will cover applied probability and mathematical statistics statistical modeling and computing machine learning data management and visualization and artificial intelligence more importantly they will be evenly split between faculty from the department of statistics and the department of computer science both of which are housed in the school of ics industry is learning very quickly that a lot of people can scrape and analyze data but to do something truly meaningful with data to make decisions that will drive the industry forward you really have to have a basic foundational understanding of the methods you re using says gillen that is what drives the philosophy of this degree the program spans five quarters with the first three quarters comprising coursework in both statistics and computer science the summer quarter is available for internships or additional courses to accommodate working professionals all courses will be offered in the late afternoon or evening and for those in need of financial assistance scholarships and financial aid are available the final quarter is the capstone course where students will work on industry derived projects gaining real world hands on experience we plan to partner with businesses to help generate not only contacts for students but also interesting capstone projects if your business is interested in sponsoring a capstone project please contact bryan munoz at mds ics uci edu furthermore because this program adds to the list of successful professional programs already offered through the school of ics students will have access to dedicated career counselors and will participate in showcase events so while the goal is to keep the initial mds cohort relatively small students will be able to leverage resources and events available through the established graduate programs it will be fairly selective so we re aiming at 50 students for the first cohort says gillen though that might grow in future years this select group of students will gain experience in using relevant data related software and technologies so they can thrive as data scientists whether their goal is to work in the tech industry or government or anywhere in between we re going to focus on taking what is learned about the foundations of these disciplines stresses gillen and applying them to real world data shani murray a campus gem uci s statistical consulting servicesa look at health and technology trends for 2021 and

statistics current course listings news seminars news seminar center for statistical consulting a look at health and technology trends for 2021 and beyond january 15 2021 the fields of computer science informatics and statistics have been influencing healthcare for decades and 2020 served as an important reminder of the critical role both healthcare and technology play in people s daily lives the covid 19 pandemic put a spotlight on healthcare while stay at home orders significantly boosted technology use in general and telehealth practices in particular looking to the new year ahead how might the connections between technology and health become further entwined and how will this impact the future of healthcare here to address these questions are three professors from the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics yunan chen associate professor of informatics whose research focuses on human computer interaction hci computer supported cooperative work cscw and health informatics nikil dutt distinguished professor of computer science who studies embedded systems healthcare iot computer aided design and brain inspired architectures and computing and bin nan professor of statistics who works to improve human health through the development of statistical and machine learning methods professors chen dutt and nan each discuss new opportunities and challenges as advances in technology lead to fundamental shifts in the healthcare industry how is your field influencing the healthcare industry and what changes do you expect to see in the next few decades yunan chen chen informatics has had a huge influence on the healthcare industry the medical field is centered on the use of information in fact the field of medical informatics was established to meet the growing demand to collect access and use health data and information in the past five to 10 years health it systems have almost completely transformed paper based medical practices into electronic health records as everything becomes digitalized huge amounts of information and data can be collected and shared across practices opening the door to new clinical research and health policies another major influence stems from the digitalization of our everyday life with advances in consumer facing health it applications individuals can now collect manage and use personal health data that was not available in the past this information can then be shared with clinicians to benefit their practices across different settings clinical home or communities informatics research and applications are helping people better access information gather data and engage in evidence based practices leading to improved public health nikil dutt dutt one big shift we re seeing is this notion of digital health the idea of using technology for better self care it s this whole idea that even the field of medicine is recognizing called p4 health which is predictive preventive personalized and participatory health instead of the traditional model of episodic healthcare where you go to the doctor or er when you re sick we re moving toward proactively shifting the emphasis to earlier phases in terms of lifestyle digital health technologies including computer science informatics and statistics are the key enablers moving us in that direction we ve always talked about personalized health but now technology lets us use data and statistics to build models of individuals that can improve the quality of healthcare by delivering services in a more targeted fashion another tremendous shift we have seen just this past year is the move to remote healthcare and telehealth covid 19 accelerated the move to delivering services using technology the other thing that we ll be soon talking about is integrating mental and physical health far too often physical and mental care are siloed and services are provided in a completely uncoordinated fashion so i see a big change with personalization and this ability to integrate all of that information in a manner that can help healthcare professionals better do their jobs and more importantly help individuals empower themselves to make decisions in an informed manner bin nan nan statistics plays a very important role in any health related research the field of so called biostatistics is evidence of that where the emphasis is on health and medical research i can name many interesting influential topics such as survival analysis and longitudinal data analysis in the past two decades technology has evolved so that people can perform fine sequencing of dna information there are also many impacts along the lines of imaging especially in neuroscience research the brain is a very interesting organ that you usually cannot access so you can t directly measure brain activity you have to rely on imaging in both areas massive data are generated and that motivates some interesting statistical research in a fast growing area called high dimensional statistics in the coming years people will increasingly use wearable devices to track data including activity data and heartbeat and temperature measurements this presents statistical challenges in terms of how you analyze the data and how you design interventions to improve human health such as a message that says you should exercise more or you need to relax i m part of uci s new institute for future health ifh led by ramesh jain and the focus is on trying to understand how we collect and use mobile device data to improve health this will be a very interesting field that s depending on technology involvement as wearable devices with well designed apps become more and more available to people so we call this the big data era new statistical methods are being developed and some of them will become much more impactful in these scientific areas which will certainly reshape scientific knowledge in the future what about covid 19 s influence how did the global pandemic impact your research chen covid is not only a global public health crisis but also an information crisis our past research in this area shows that during a public health crisis information is often uncertain and ambiguous challenging how people perceive personal risks and make decisions it is crucial for informatics researchers like us to examine the use of information and technologies during this challenging time i ve been doing a multicultural study on contact tracing technologies for covid 19 in the u s korea and japan working with informatics professor daniel epstein and a group of international collaborators we started looking at human tracers and technology tracers and under different conditions when people prefer humans versus technology one of our findings to be presented at chi 21 is that when people have to report their symptoms during a 14 day quarantine they prefer technology check ins but when being notified of a covid positive diagnosis or of exposure to the virus people prefer to talk to a human so they can ask questions and receive emotional assurance right now we re doing a similar study in korea and also a survey in japan as they recently rolled out their national covid tracing system i ve also worked on a collaborative project looking into people s risk perceptions during the pandemic and how those perceptions might change as the pandemic wears on again findings to be presented at chi 21 in another study we looked into the beliefs of those who oppose facial masks we used a combination of machine learning and qualitative content analysis methods to analyze twitter data from january to october 2020 this study reveals the temporal trend of public opinions and the reasons why some people do not support mask wearing helping us understand public concerns and learn how to better communicate health policies to the public dutt one of the big projects i m working on is called unite underserved communities which provides services so that underserved pregnant women can take better care of themselves the project uses what we call a community health worker model where a community health worker traditionally goes in and visits with the mom periodically what we were looking at is how wearable technology can provide ubiquitous continuous monitoring that closes the loop by augmenting what happens during the physical visits we re doing the pilot study now so covid actually allowed us to test this intervention which became even more important when health workers could no longer visit the women at their homes so i think that provided us with an opportunity to test it and show that digital services can help people in this instance pregnant moms take better care of themselves also together with psychology professor jesse borelli we were looking at stress management of college kids we started this before covid recruiting between 10 to 30 students for each cohort using a combination of physiological monitoring with wearables and ecological momentary assessment ema questionnaires delivered on an app we combined the students physical health with their mental health state to evaluate and track their stress levels over time and provide feedback as covid hit we saw huge rises in stress levels it was extremely important to see what these kids were going through but it s also very exciting to use these digital technologies to build a personalized model nan covid did not interrupt my research too much since most of my research activities are now on zoom meanwhile i got a chance to work with professor jonathan watanabe from the uci school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences who is interested in how doctors treat covid 19 patients he was trying to understand the patterns of different medicine use over time among different patient categories the data set that we used was from the electronic health records another source of big data for health research of the uc system we have five medical schools and many many hospitals in the uc system and we have access to that data which is updated on a daily basis about what medicines were prescribed to the patients this is observational and descriptive not a clinical evaluation but it s very interesting work covid 19 has also highlighted racial disparities in healthcare what role do you think racial justice plays in healthcare and technology chen it definitely plays a huge role there have been recent studies outside of the healthcare world about how if the training data of ai systems does not include a certain population then the algorithms developed based on such data might lead to potential bias in the healthcare field i could imagine such scenarios in future ai assistant practices if the systems don t have enough training data for underrepresented populations or economically disadvantaged communities that could lead to serious consequences since we don t have universal healthcare in the u s it s really hard for some people to afford certain treatments for example infertility treatments if a technology is developed based on patient data with participation only by people who can afford it then bias can be embedded into the design i ve also seen studies looking into how technology can help clinicians avoid implicit bias when treating patients if they subconsciously describe things differently to different patients or maybe use a different tone or style of interaction if we look at the future of the entire healthcare industry and insurance more broadly there have been some articles about how if you are inherently prone to develop some kind of disease based on your medical history we would have different kinds of insurance that s one of the ethical issues we discuss in my medical informatics class with more algorithms and decision support being deployed in the healthcare field we need to be careful to not widen health disparity or inequity through technology design dutt that s so important we have a planning grant with nursing colleagues professor amir rahmani and dean adey nyamathi for a new nsf program called the future of work our grant digital health for future of community centered care is looking at community centered care because we all know that a large part of the cost of healthcare comes from training doctors and nurses but if you look at underserved populations community workers are the ones who actually interface with people and then report back to nurses or doctors so we feel that technology can empower and grow these types of services to help underserved communities especially in this climate so you asked what role does racial justice play and i m kind of turning that around saying technology has a tremendous role to play in providing services for the most underserved communities an example is the work we re doing through unite with moms orange county but i think we can take that kind of model and scale it i ll give you two instances that we ve discussed one is looking at mechanisms to help deliver services to the homeless community and another one is the meals on wheels program which delivers food to typically underserved elderly populations and these individuals are not only underserved but also might be going through life changes where they may be having early onset of dementia or they might not be taking care of themselves so how can we use technology to help identify problems early and communicate and address that nan in healthcare we see racial discrepancies all the time for example i was involved in a project looking at medicare data for end stage renal disease patients usually the standard treatment is dialysis for this cms centers for medicare medicaid services project we developed measures to evaluate the performance of dialysis facilities one of the issues we often see is racial discrepancy it s always there sometimes disparities can be explained biologically different genetic makeup for example but many are actually due to the social economic status how to address that is the billion dollar question people of color have disadvantages in terms of access to quality healthcare which directly impacts their health status there s a big debate about universal healthcare but i think that in a rich country like the u s everyone should have a certain level of care what other major challenges do we as a society need to address in the next five years chen now that we are able to collect a large amount of personal health data both by healthcare professionals and consumers the major challenge we face is how to better utilize such data to meet the diverse needs of stakeholders we often hear clinicians complaining about not having enough time to review the data patient brought to the clinic or patients being confused or distressed by their own health data there are structured constraints in our healthcare system that do not allocate physicians enough time to perform the data work brought on by new technologies on the consumer side users might not have sufficient knowledge skills and literacy to manage their own data and health how do we design health it systems that both provide data access as well as allow appropriate use of such data avoiding unintended negative consequences so beyond the technical aspect the human and social aspects of design are even more important how do you visualize and present the data to different stakeholders sometimes the systems also generate suggestions or predictions you might get diabetes if you continue leading this kind of lifestyle or if a prediction says you won t get pregnant in the next five days do you trust it and who is taking responsibility for the consequences we need to design technologies to not only collect data but also present it in a way that makes sense and that addresses diverse users data needs and to let users understand their data instead of over trusting it we did a fertility technology study and found the technology implicitly placed both physical and emotional burden on individuals trying to conceive many apps were following social norms making the women not their partners track the data but is that really the right way to do it so that s part of the challenge we need more experts who can connect both the technical side and the medical health side to create better healthcare technologies dutt one of the biggest challenges is finding how we move from episodic event based medical care to a model that s more integrated holistic and proactive this requires us to personalize the model to the individual spanning not only biomarkers to show if you re at risk for say heart disease but also the mental health aspect breaking down siloed healthcare to deliver integrated services will be critical this challenge transcends computer science and goes to the root of how policymakers and the government look at and fund healthcare in society if you look at how we re trying to achieve this vision of empowering people and developing personal models we can do that in smaller pilot studies but achieving it in practice is a huge challenge the other major barrier is privacy which varies not only from person to person but also very importantly as a person s health condition changes i m a healthy young adult and i m invincible so i don t want to share my data but you take an aging individual and there you get into all kinds of issues maybe in principle they don t want to share their health information but because of their condition they might need to maybe they re suffering from dementia it s a very complicated issue so how can we develop policies and infrastructures that can manage the privacy requirements of healthcare as the health state of an individual changes over time that s a very interesting aspect that colleagues here including professor sharad mehrotra have been working on nan again focusing on statistical research in health one of the greatest challenges in the next five years will be better understanding deep learning ai algorithms and being able to do some sort of reliable statistical inference on those models deep learning algorithms have been very successful in many areas of health research especially in radiology there are many interesting examples of the machine doing better than even the best trained radiologists when you have huge amounts of data you can train the algorithm to do more precise diagnoses but one challenge from the statistical side is trying to understand the effects of the predictors for example the risk factors to a disease statisticians build simple models that are easily interpretable but deep learning algorithms are usually a black box type of thing we don t really know what s going on inside the black box the algorithm can usually achieve a pretty good prediction but we still need to understand it more in order to find modifiable risk factors to improve people s health or to gain knowledge of disease mechanisms so we ll need statisticians and computer science researchers working together to open the black box finally what research will you be focused on in the coming year chen i m going to continue focusing on data driven technologies and examining the data work of individuals engaging in their everyday health practices we re doing a project on asthma with one of my ph d students imagine you have an inhaler that tracks your locations and notes where you take medications and senses certain environmental variables so how do individuals their caregivers and their healthcare providers benefit from such data and how can we design the right technologies to support their data work increasingly these data driven technologies are coupled with ai to provide algorithmic advice such as suggestions or predictions if the app tells you when and where you are more likely to have an asthma attack would you trust and follow such a prediction how do you make sure that the ai is accurate so i think on both the clinical and patient sides that s a really interesting direction i ll be working on including as it relates to smart health technology such as the smart diaper that tells you when it needs to be changed or the smart app that predicts your fertility window or tells you when to feed your baby increasingly society which is enthusiastic about data and ai is going to push for changes in how we manage our health and lifestyles so we need to make sure these technologies are designed properly dutt some exciting projects are in the works through the new institute for future health ifh we talked about unite and mental health and another area is food because what we eat can affect our mood and our physical health so a new line of research we ve started looking into together with professors ramesh jain and amir rahmani in the school of nursing relates to the new topic of food computing another ongoing effort is in pain assessment where we are trying to quantify the level of pain for subjects who are not able to communicate such as people just coming out of surgery or neonatal infants this will help doctors and nurses determine whether to administer pain medication and how much we re doing a small study with the uci medical center looking at some post operative patients to create a baseline and build a model using facial monitoring and measuring facial muscles and sweat and heart rate it s very exciting finally using data sets that we can access through the uc system we re doing covid detection intervention and prediction studies so it s quite a portfolio of projects and i am really excited that i m at uci it s a pleasure to wake up every morning and work with all these really bright people nan my personal research is on aging in general and alzheimer s disease in particular one of the problems i m thinking about is how to estimate alzheimer s disease prevalence a challenging issue is in survival analysis which is my field of interest the commonly used mathematical models implicitly assume that people can live forever you don t say people have to die before age 150 even though that s what we observe in the real world in fact that kind of modeling assumption is very hard to handle for aging studies which focus on the end of life so the idea i m proposing is to look at people who have already died to see who developed the disease during their lifetime and who didn t where the lifetimes are finite that s clearer information trying to understand during a lifetime who developed the disease when it happened and how it relates to certain risk factors it s natural to ask the question in a forward way how many people will get the disease in the next five years but my way of thinking is also going backwards looking at people s entire lifetimes to hopefully provide more precise estimation about this disease and a better evaluation of risk factors this is a new framework totally different from what people have been doing in the past and hopefully it will lead to important discoveries shani murray uci launches new professional program master of data scienceamstat news celebrating women in statistics 2021 annie qu

s really a career path in sports related to uci s data science major if so the webinar series being offered by the sport statistics group uci through the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics should be of interest to you the next webinar to be held on may 21 2021 will feature brendan kent a senior business data analyst at draftkings and creator and host of the measurables podcast there s a lot of interest around sports research right now says statistics professor michele guindani who is helping ph d student corey brett katz lead the new group along with statistics professors hal stern and weining shen sports excites many people so we ve started hosting seminars to introduce students to the types of problems one might work on in sports stats providing a behind the scenes look at sports statsin the february webinar presenting sports research to an average sports fan espn senior sports analytics specialist paul sabin talked about the work that goes into providing the game predictions shared by espn newscasters and appearing on the channel s news ticker the sport statistics group s february webinar featured espn senior sports analytics specialist paul sabin in particular he recounted his first few months at espn when he was tasked with improving the college basketball power index bpi leading into the 2016 ncaa basketball tournament using a bayesian model with coefficients such as home team or away team and distance traveled he did a posterior predictive distribution which espn started using for its on air predictions after the final four games for the men s tournament the model sabin developed gave villanova a 50 1 chance to win the championship over north carolina people don t realize that 50 1 and 49 9 are essentially the same thing statistically they ve very similar explained sabin regardless the prediction running along the bottom of the espn channel had villanova with its 50 1 favored to win when you work in sports you start having these rooting interests that have nothing to do with anything rational admitted sabin who had no ties to either school and didn t really care who won yet based on his model espn had predicted a villanova win so he suddenly became very invested in that outcome i have never been more nervous than i was at this moment he replayed the moment he was referring to during the webinar transporting viewers to the final seconds of the 2016 championship just as north carolina tied the game well my model was very close 50 and the game is tied with five seconds left he recalled thinking at the time that s what the highest probability was this outcome but i also wanted people to not lose trust in me villanova then won the game with a buzzer beater basket the game had an incredible finish said sabin and the espn prediction had been correct there s more to the story including a statistical twist and lessons learned so if you re affiliated with uci be sure to watch the recording with your ucnet id during the webinar sabin also talked about how it was sports that really generated my love of statistics in the first place and he explained how using sports analogies helped him make sense of difficult concepts in college when he couldn t grasp the idea of n dimensional space he thought of it in terms of having five different variables and trying to predict the outcome of a game it s easier to understand concepts if applied to a passion like sports he said which he views as opportunity for introducing new students to statistics i m a big believer that using sports can help increase diversity in stem education guindani similarly views sports as a potential recruitment tool it s an area that provides opportunities for getting students excited about statistics leveraging sports webinars for recruitmentsabin s talk was one of a series of webinars offered by the sport statistics group recordings of the other webinars are available online with your ucnet id career paths in statistics with luke bornn co founder and chief scientist of zelus analytics recording data and statistics in baseball what it s like to work in a baseball analytics department with kevin ferris of

earlier the next webinar will feature brendan kent of draftkings and creator the measurables educational sports analytics and sports tech podcast while a ucnet id is required to view recordings of previous events the live webinars are open to anyone from high school students exploring potential majors and career options to professional sports analysts or even international statisticians visit the events page for log in information however the long term goal of these webinars is to help recruit a dedicated group of uci students interested in working on a variety of projects related to sports stats the hope is that students after watching a webinar will get involved with the sport statistics uci group any uci students can join the group all ics students are welcome as well as students who might be majoring in a different field e g economics or psychology says guindani it would be awesome to put together a group that could eventually collaborate with uci s athletics

capstone course in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics was in 2009 with 19 students from the department of informatics working on five project teams now more than a decade later the informatics capstone course is offered three times a year and ics has added undergraduate capstone courses for its computer science and data science majors it also offers capstone courses through its master of human computer interaction and design mhcid master of computer science mcs and master of software engineering mswe professional programs even with the global pandemic moving people out of classrooms and offices and into online spaces this past year more than 130 ics capstone projects were successfully completed tremendous growth we re growing in leaps and bounds says informatics professor hadar ziv who led that first capstone course so many years ago this growth was on full display at the ics spring 2021 capstone student design showcase where nine of the 12 projects presented were a mere sampling of the more than 60 projects completed for the undergraduate informatics computer science and data science capstone programs this year you can view many of the student capstone videos online it was hard to select projects for the showcase because they all were very competitive says professor sergio gago masague who led the new computer science capstone and its 16 projects after a successful pilot version last year the course has already grown from 50 to 70 students and gago masague plans to scale it up again next year the capstone required for the data science major the first such undergraduate degree program offered in the uc system resulted in 14 projects created by 42 students this year the course is co taught by two faculty members each year one from the computer science department and one from the statistics department the balanced and rigorous curriculum of the data science major allows students to take on a wide range of ambitious capstone projects ranging from predicting medical treatment effects using electronic health records to using time series techniques to forecast product demand stresses statistics professor vladimir minin who directed the data science program the last three years starting july 1 2021 statistics professor mine dogucu will take the helm of the program the other three projects presented at the capstone student design showcase were award winning designs from the butterworth design competition a software development competition open to ics students the top prize and 10 000 was awarded to the grasshopper fund a startup marketplace and funding platform ics has also witnessed growth at the graduate level with the mcs spring 2021 capstone showcase featuring 18 different projects one of which armory took third place in the butterworth design competition mcs students working on the armory interactive platform which lets developers experiment with various cybersecurity threats so they can proactively write secure code were awarded 3 500 this year another seven projects were completed for the mhcid program and a joint mcs and mswe winter showcase in december presented 46 projects ten of which were created by the inaugural mswe cohort of 34 students quantity and qualitythe growing number of projects isn t the only impressive element of the ics capstone program the quality of the projects is also increasing says jason king associate director of corporate relations in ics we re seeing more success stories on both the student and sponsor side as we refine the capstone process and devote more time up front to setting up the projects this benefits the students faculty and corporate sponsors we re not just doing projects to do projects he says we re ensuring students gain the hands on experience and soft skills needed for future success ziv agrees a couple of my teams were not only the best in their class but among the best i ve taught in 12 years or so he said referring to the adventure biofeedback project where students created a game environment to make speech therapy for kids fun and the dreams for schools project where students helped a nonprofit stem education program scale up its operations the game environment for the adventure biofeedback project in developing the speech therapy application computer software engineering major eduardo magdaleno said it was an opportunity for him to apply all of my culminated skills that i learned during my four years at uci he was able to practice agile development project management hci and more while working closely with the stakeholders i did demos and user testing and learned that talking and eliciting the right questions was very important so our application could be built with the users in mind informatics major stella adriana who helped design an instructor assignment sorter for dreams for schools similarly talked during the showcase about how the project helped her learn how to effectively communicate with developers google software engineer tim laubach one of more than 120 participants at the online capstone student design showcase stressed the importance of the students learning this lesson the most beautiful design in the world if it can t be implemented doesn t help the user gaining this practical hands one experience is what the capstone courses are all about there are things we just can t teach in a traditional classroom the capstone course gives students a leg up as they transition out of their undergraduate degree and into their careers says informatics lecturer matthew bietz who taught one of the capstone courses this year even those who already have a background in industry have a lot to gain from the capstone experience working on this project has expanded my knowledge of agile development and working on a team which will be significant in my career progression says mcs student uddeshya kumar who worked on an artistic photos application to help people create art from photos this project gave me the opportunity to learn new technologies that align with my professional goals and will prove to be crucial in the near future a presentation of the artistic photos application the project sponsors are yet another beneficiary of the capstone courses project sponsors tell me again and again how happy they are to have worked with the students says bietz some sponsors come from nonprofits and just this quarter our students built apps to help victims of trafficking to support parents of children with developmental disabilities and to help cancer patients better understand their treatment using 3d visualization to name just a few he says some sponsors join us from startups or larger tech companies and in addition to creating marketable products working with the students is a way to identify individuals they want to recruit this form of networking is invaluable to students and sponsors alike for all of the skill building and new knowledge the students get says bietz the real impacts of the capstone program lie in building relationships careers and passions if you are a company interested in sponsoring an undergraduate or

second ever virtual ceremony nevertheless represented something extraordinary the class of 2021 will have a unique place in our institutional memory as the most resilient and responsive class we have ever had the privilege of teaching said chancellor howard gillman during his opening remarks under the most extraordinary circumstances you rose to the occasion supported each other adapted and persisted as gillman lamented the physical separation of the occasion instead of the traditional gathering in the bren center he emphasized that no matter our physical circumstances we are right now anteaters together marking this great moment in your life graduates of the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics heard a similar sentiment from dean marios c papaefthymiou in his welcome for the ics ceremony ics expects to confer more than 1 200 undergraduate and 100 graduate degrees this year although the hybrid nature of this commencement is not as gratifying as an in person live ceremony the significance of the event remains as strong as ever said papaefthymiou as the class of 2021 transitioned from students to graduates joining a network of more than 10 000 ics alumni papaefthymiou spoke of their larger role in society our aspiration is that you re graduating from our program equipped to make a positive impact on our world using technology to do good and leading in creating a better future for everyone four student commencement speakers then recalled their anteater journeys starting with tiffany kong although kong has already secured a position as an engineer at qualcomm she admitted that she had no intention of graduating with a bachelor s degree in computer science when she first came to uci i never really thought about working in the tech or software industry let alone majoring in computer science but i did know three things i enjoyed math i enjoyed art and i really wanted to attend uci she told her fellow classmates through computer science i came to enjoy a variety of topics such as ai and hci because they provide a perfect blend between art and design and math and technology she spoke of both the devastation she felt after failing ics 32 as well as the courage she mustered to successfully retake the course for me failing a class seemed like a nightmare or even now for us graduating into a pandemic it s hard to get out of that doomsday mindset she said however this is what has made us stronger all these challenges that we have gone through have proven to us that we have never let doubt consume us similar to kong software engineering graduate jennifer kwon also found her passion at uci after taking a project management course my time at uci has brought me invaluable skills and i couldn t have asked for a better experience here she said she was driven to succeed taking courses over summer to continue her learning her senior capstone class provided one of her most memorable experiences as she conducted a research study in collaboration with the children s hospital of orange county to make speech therapy fun for kids the project was recently highlighted during the ics spring 2021 capstone student design showcase kwon

his journey to this moment born with autism i m so grateful today to receive my bachelor s degree after studying for five and a half years he said noting that learning algorithms and programming c and systemverilog was especially difficult for him requiring more than twice the time needed for other students yet he persevered i truly feel that any goal is possible if we put our mind heart and soul into it he told his classmates my biggest wish today is to encourage you whether autistic or not to always have hope kindness and perseverance so the highest purpose can be reached first generation low income latino student francisco loya spoke of the resilience of this class of 2021 in particular a bird sitting in a tree is never afraid of the branch breaking because her trust is not in the branch but in her own wings said the computer science graduate the students who have gone through uci before us have passed tough classes met great people and graduated each and every one of us has done the same but have done so while assisting sick family members getting internships and job offers rescinded and fighting for equality he noted so yes we are now graduating with a degree but the strongest asset we ve proven that we have is grit and a strong work ethic the class of 2021 is indeed unique in having overcome the yearlong upheaval caused by the global pandemic each graduating student whose name was read with pomp and circumstance playing in the background as their slide flashed on the screen has their own story of overcoming challenges in earning their ics degree particularly during their final year in the program yet each and every one showed great determination in reaching this moment and will forever share a special place in history as that most resilient

been known for its impressive machine learning repository with more than 580 publicly accessible datasets the repository serves as a tremendous resource for empirical and methodological research in machine learning it also serves as a great learning tool for uci students thanks to the second annual ml hackathon a student competition funded by the national science foundation the uci research community donated nine challenge datasets from the repository for the event and the research cyberinfrastructure center rcic provided the computational resources we wanted to create a fun opportunity for students to engage with real projects within the uci research community says tamanna hossain a graduate student in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics who organized this year s hackathon my favorite part of the event was definitely the enthusiasm and curiosity students brought to the table especially under the difficult conditions of the ongoing covid 19 pandemic ten teams participated in the virtual hackathon held may 14 through may 23 2021 and competed for the top prize of 500 for best overall and for four 250 prizes awarded for technical skills scientific insights creativity and best presentation yu miyauchi award winning hacksthe top prize went to hatomugi an ml model designed to detect fake reviews on yelp developed by data science major yu miyauchi the model leveraged the yelpnyc challenge dataset which contains 359 052 yelp reviews for restaurants in new york city miyauchi who graduated in june and is now a data analysis consultant at deloitte says this competition was a great way to simulate my future work yu miyauchi explaining his machine learning model for fake review detection in yelp qingchuan yang yihan wang another hack using the yelpnyc data was aces2alliance which won the technical skills award data science major yihan wang and computer science major qingchuan yang applied deep learning algorithms to predict whether an unlabeled yelp review was real or fake i was not expecting to win the award at the end says wang but i am grateful to ics for giving the current students a platform to showcase the skills we have learned yang added that it was exciting to apply ml theories learned from lectures to practice and see how powerful they are andrew chen the award for scientific insights went to i am a segmentation fault developed by computer science major andrew chen using the dataset containing climate change and ecosystem carbon information in california i created a regressor that predicts carbon densities in california based on projected temperature and precipitation conditions he says this event was a great opportunity to use the theoretical machine learning skills that we heard about in class on real world data sets richard lopez and rionel dmello the most creative hack was two truths and a lie developed by computer science majors rionel dmello and richard lopez given a misconception and tweet pair our goal was to detect if that tweet propagates the misconception allowing content moderation on social media the students used the covidlies dataset of approximately 6 000 tweet and misconception pairs and fasttext a shallow neural network to extract word embeddings i enjoyed working on a project that was so closely related to the pandemic and i understand the challenges that big tech faces in regard to reducing the spread of misinformation says dmello my partner and i also had to come up with innovative ways to communicate and share information over various platforms which was a challenge in itself lopez agrees working on a covid related project in the middle of the pandemic was quite an adventure randy huynh top left ruslan manahoran top right and william hou another hack using the covidlies dataset was wtawtaw which won the presentation award for this hack first year computer science students randy huynh and ruslan manahoran along with first year data science student william hou focused on characterizing common covid 19 misconceptions and developing a model to detect their presence covid 19 has had such a huge impact on our lives and all around the world and it was really interesting to explore how rampant covid 19 misinformation is on the internet says the teammates through our research we were able to determine commonalities between misinformative tweets such as word and phrase choice types of misinformation certain themes etc we hope our project will contribute to the development of more robust misinformation detection models in the future advancing ml researchin addition to the competition the event included ml research talks by computer science professor sameer singh and computer science ph d students sam showalter anthony chen dylan slack and gavin kerrigan singh chancellor s professor padhraic smyth and rcic director philip papadopoulos served as faculty mentors throughout the event and because all of the projects completed were open source the hackathon work contributed to ml research as well this is an amazing opportunity for undergraduates not only to gain hands on experience with applying machine learning to real problems which can really help them get jobs in machine learning but further working on scientific problems offered by uci faculty means that the undergraduates are helping advanced research i wish i had such opportunities as an undergrad says singh it is also a great opportunity for the faculty across campus to use our excellent ics undergraduates to prototype what applying ml to their projects would look

receiving the george cobb award on july 27 2021 utts received the dinsdale award from the society for scientific exploration sse she learned of the honor at sse pa connections 2021 a joint online conference between the sse and the parapsychological association pa established in 1992 the award named after tim dinsdale recognizes significant contributions to the expansion of human understanding through the study of unexplained phenomena it aims to reward senior scholars who have significantly contributed to our understanding of anomalous physical biological and psychological events in the spirit of meticulous research exemplary methodology and proper scholarly attitude utts received the award for significant contributions in the rigorous application of statistical methods to the study of psi shorthand for parapsychology including remote perception presentiment and distant healing i was delighted to have my work recognized by receiving the dinsdale award and was particularly pleased that the awardee immediately preceding me was hal puthoff who first introduced me to this research area says utts who met puthoff many years ago at an see conference puthoff was the director of the government funded research program studying psychic abilities and their possible use for intelligence gathering he was looking for a statistical consultant for a program based out of sri international utts became a consultant for the program and still collaborates with parapsychology researchers to this day about half of my research publications are related to my work in parapsychology she says noting that her most prominent work was a report she put together for congress my work was a part of the full report evaluating the government work on psychic abilities commonly referred to by one of its code names stargate she says that report led to appearances on cnn larry king live and lots of other media outlets the dinsdale award appropriately spotlights how utts leveraged her ph d work in statistics and her undergraduate study of both math and psychology to push the boundaries of mainstream science and advance the field of parapsychology all while continuing to advance statistics

professional goals december 8 2021 women have been historically underrepresented in stem and that trend continues today the pew research center found that women make up 25 of computing occupations and girls make up approximately 30 of ap computer science test takers girls and women face a number of challenges in the stem field which is why uci s master of data science program aims to make stem more accessible to underrepresented groups our goal is to diversify the field of data science and break the mold we want to increase female representation in tech and also help improve social mobility for underrepresented groups in the u s mds program manager bryan mu oz said the mds program launched in fall 2021 welcomed 25 students in its inaugural class of 2022 thirty two percent of the first mds cohort are women one of them being adelynn paik who serves as one of five mds program ambassadors as ambassadors we act as representatives of the program to prospective students and potential company partners paik said we are also the first point of contact for many applicants so i hope to be a welcoming face for all to prospective mds program female candidates seeing how women like paik can thrive in computing fields is inspirational because they see how they too belong in stem having leaders and programs that strive to make stem more inclusive also helps change discriminatory attitudes that women often endure from not being taken seriously to experiencing sexist policies my challenges as a woman in stem started with two discrediting high school math teachers and have taken a number of different forms since then paik said i think the worst part is when the misogyny cannibalizes your mind and you start to make yourself small even without a perpetrator it takes work to choose not to be bitter or afraid some days more than others and to re center yourself in your own path in her position as an mds program ambassador paik hopes to contribute to the efforts to make the sciences more welcoming and supportive of women i can be part of the normalization of women excelling in this program especially in its infancy she said alongside making data science less unfamiliar to potential female students another goal that paik wants to achieve in the mds program is expanding her knowledge of data science while developing a burgeoning focus on one specific field paik s interest in data science comes from her longtime passion for stem particularly math and her undergraduate education at the massachusetts institute of technology mit she majored in systems engineering within mit s civil engineering department and received her degree in 2021 paik was also involved in two research groups at mit work of the future and glaciers group the first was the work of the future task force which was an interdisciplinary effort to analyze the impact of increasing automation on future jobs my mentor and i investigated automotive startup activity by collecting both qualitative and quantitative data paik said i was also briefly part of the glaciers group where i used computer vision to track the longitudinal movement of a glacier front as someone who decided to study systems engineering because she wanted to learn about how people move and live paik said the research she conducted at mit reflects her interests in the realms of city development transportation planning and the environment she added that her systems engineering education at mit which was rooted in mathematical and technical material translates well to her current graduate school education data science seems like the swiss army knife of majors in its applicability across fields i cannot think of an industry that doesn t make use of data in some way paik said at uci s mds program i m gaining useful skills while giving myself the chance to learn about the job landscape through offerings such as career counseling and the capstone project when paik isn t playing around with numbers you can find her taking classes on improv at the groundlings theatre school where she s a two time diversity scholarship recipient or doing stand up comedy i love that communal feeling of being in a cramped dimly lit room telling jokes to an audience and hanging out with other comedians as an asian american woman i find it s a great exercise in taking up space and defying the label that we are subservient she said what marries together the realms of comedy and stem for paik are how they empower women of color to be loud and let our talents represent us the optimism initiative and passion that paik has in her academics hobbies and beyond are sure to help her achieve her goals in the mds program in the short term i look forward to claiming a specialty within data science and starting a career in the environmental transportation healthcare or entertainment industry paik said my long term goal is to remain hopeful and work on projects with people i respect and admire karen phan disney

news seminar center for statistical consulting tech trends for 2022 january 10 2022 ics professors daniel epstein mohsen imani and tianchen qian discuss their research and the technological developments they expect in the coming year the new year starts with healthcare front and center as covid 19 continues to impact people s daily lives throughout the pandemic the fields of computer science informatics and statistics have all played an important role in helping people move their lives online stay connected and analyze vast amounts of data for informed decision making how will these fields continue to advance virtual and augmented spaces find new ways to bring people together and improve healthcare analytics and interventions in the coming year here to answer these questions while covering an array of topics including artificial intelligence ai wearables the aging population mental health and cybersecurity are three professors from the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics daniel epstein assistant professor of informatics and leader of the personal informatics everyday pie lab studies personal tracking technology and designs devices and apps that help people better track everything from health and fitness to finances and productivity mohsen imani assistant professor of computer science is working on a wide range of practical problems in the area of bio inspired computing machine learning computer architecture and embedded systems tianchen qian assistant professor of statistics works to develop methodology to understand causal relationships through the analysis of highly complex data with applications focusing on health and wearable technology the unique structure of ics as a standalone school with three departments computer science informatics and statistics makes it the perfect environment for exploring all aspects of computing and technology and the impact on society let s see what technological developments these three scholars expect to see in 2022 what technology advances are you most excited about as we head into 2022 daniel epstein epstein far from my area of expertise augmented reality has only recently become viable on people s everyday phones while i m skeptical that it will revolutionize the way we communicate with one another i m hopeful that it will help us create richer experiences once we find the right niches where the technology is really valuable i m also excited to hopefully see us take all of the big advances in conversational agents into important areas where people find them useful current research says they re mainly just used for setting timers and playing music my student lucas silva has been examining how voice assistants can make food journaling less burdensome and fit in with everyday technology use like using an alexa instead of your phone to log what you just ate while your hands are busy doing the dishes mohsen imani imani this pandemic has proven that virtual reality vr is an essential technology for our future communication vr will make significant changes in how we communicate with computers and each other it will shorten physical boundaries by giving us virtual feelings besides vr i am also excited to see the next generation of wearable devices and health monitoring technologies that could change the quality of healthcare systems tianchen qian qian i m most excited about the advances in wearable device and sensor technology and in particular their increasing applications in healthcare with these technology we are getting better at detecting the state of an individual such as stress level and location and potentially delivering behavior change interventions to them in real time this provides ample opportunity to improve health but also brings a lot of challenges such as how to balance the therapeutic effect of the interventions and the burden of receiving interventions through smartphone and wearable devices what is the next big challenge you think society will face and how will your field help epstein covid 19 forced us to radically restructure how we live and work with one another while there is certainly some appetite to return to normal for many people normal was worse or wasn t good either i think the big challenge for society is thinking through what changes for the better emerged from our situation and how do we not lose those in a foolhardy attempt to wipe the memory of the pandemic from the vantage point of informatics i particularly see us helping out in understanding how technology helped move activities that were in person to online and advocating for the things that became better from being online everything from online education to telemedicine to how people socialize with one another imani we face increasing needs for efficient and real time processing for diverse cognitive tasks using a vast volume of generated data deep learning and ai are predicted to make evolutionary changes in many areas including healthcare finance and cybersecurity to extract useful information applications often rely on sophisticated and costly machine learning and ai algorithms that lack transparency robustness and have long latency and high power consumption for realistic intelligent and effective systems to be developed and deployed there are crucial needs for scalable learning and computing methods on embedded devices for example algorithms that now run on large scale data centers with kilowatt power consumption need to be processed in real time on our daily used smart devices for example a smartwatch and smart glass this requires fundamental changes on the algorithm and underlying hardware qian the current one is obviously the pandemic which my colleagues have thoughtfully commented on the next big challenge in my view is the aging population and how to improve the quality of life for the elderly with longer life expectancy and lower birth rate the composition of the age pyramid is transitioning toward an older population and there are many challenges ahead how would the society take care of the elderly when a large proportion of the society are themselves old how can we empower the elderly with modern technology so that they can enjoy their lives without the assistance of another human for a longer period of time how can their quality of life be further improved while respecting the inevitable decline in physical and mental capabilities my collaborators from uci mind and i are investigating the early signs for alzheimer s disease and other cognitive disorders we are looking at the data from uci s 90 study where hundreds of individuals over 90 years old have been followed for years and have has their cognitive performance assessed over time we hope to identify features that can be used to predict cognitive disorders and bring new insights into the process everyone will face aging how is your field affecting people s day to day lives epstein in my mind informatics is at the forefront of taking technology advances and seriously thinking about how they can should and even shouldn t impact people s everyday lives in my specific area of personal health we re understanding how people feel about the well being technology they use every day and are testing out new ideas for improving those technologies based on research we ve seen health apps like apple health move from showing people pretty boring bar graphs of how much they walk each day to more useful insights and trends we ve also seen apps improve since earlier work in 2017 how they support people of more varied identities and goals such as menstrual health apps better supporting transgender and non binary individuals and all people across their health lifecycle some changes might feel subtle but they go a long way toward helping people get the health support they need from technology imani my research on hyperdimensional computing hdc aims to redesign algorithms using strategies that more closely model the human brain this new direction is an alternative paradigm that mimics important brain functionalities toward high efficiency and noise tolerant computation hdc is motivated by the observation that the human brain operates on high dimensional data representations hdc incorporates learning capability along with typical memory functions of storing loading information hdc has shown several advantages as the next generation of cognitive machines to enable human like intelligence first instead of requiring many iterations and data points for training hdc can learn in a single iteration from just a few examples second hdc operations are highly parallel and lightweight thus empowering online learning on our daily used smart devices finally hdc has a natural robustness to noise which is essential for current unreliable network and hardware technologies qian i would like to talk about the elephant in the room which is having a huge impact on people s day to day lives right now the covid 19 pandemic statistics has played an important role in our society s joint effort to combat covid 19 enabling us to efficiently and appropriately use data to make informed decisions it has helped us monitor cases model disease spread develop vaccines and assess their effectiveness establish guidelines on dosage and boosters and predict the future trajectory of the pandemic to guide policymaking what industry will experience the most changes based on computing advances in the next five years epstein like every year recently the question is which industries won t be heavily impacted by computing advances closest to my work i m expecting we ll reach an inflection point where healthcare takes more seriously what patients are experiencing outside of their clinical visits we re already seeing telehealth and messaging a doctor systems being widely available and used but i think we ll start seeing these systems extended to include more options for care for example at home covid tests have become big and i wouldn t be surprised to see those sorts of records be better digitized and structured to support population health but i also expect other industries will be seriously changed too imani there is no doubt that all industries will experience major changes using emerging ai techniques but i will highlight two in particular healthcare and cybersecurity ai powered health monitoring technology can help doctors prioritize patients and provide urgent care to those in the most danger thereby saving lives in addition such technology for example in the form of a lightweight wearable device like a bracelet also offers a convenient method for patients to monitor their own health ai technologies are also stepping in to help improve cyber resilience as security issues have started presenting a day to day struggle for businesses attackers are getting smarter so our cybersecurity must grow smarter too it is essential to deploy effective cybersecurity technology based on future machine learning algorithms with higher intelligence efficiency and human like reasoning capability qian i think one of them would be healthcare our healthcare model is transitioning from episodic event based care to integrated preventative and holistic care the advances in computation and ai are among the key facilitators for this transition with the rapid advances in wearable technology more and more people will be able to get care when and where they need it the most and i m not just talking about physical health mental health is an equally important aspect and its care stands to be greatly transformed by technology advances imagine someone who is trying to quit smoking wearable sensors nowadays allow us to use prediction algorithms to detect in real time when a user is stressed a big risk factor for relapse in smokers furthermore we now have the capability to immediately act on this real time prediction through digital interventions delivered through the wearable device or a smartphone such as recommending a mindfulness exercise to the individual to help reduce their stress level all these can be done without the involvement of another human being these type of smartphone and wearable based health interventions are also being developed in various other domains such as physical activity bipolar disorder substance abuse and so on i can only imagine how many more there will be in the next five years to transform healthcare and people s well being what research projects will you be focused on in the coming year epstein together with my students i m focused on moving people s health tracking practices beyond individual apps or experiences and into the complex circumstances where people use technology for example supported by an icts pilot award my student eunkyung jo is planning to bridge the gap between health data that patients collect and how doctors use that data we re planning to develop ways to annotate health questionnaires that your doctor might give you to fill out at home like symptom logs with your own data two of my other students dennis wang and xi lu are looking at what role social media should play in helping people get support and advice around the health data they collect and understanding why apps like myfitnesspal and weight watchers don t seem to be enough to serve those goals supported by snap research we ve been working on using data to help people who are meditating together become more aware of each other s mental states imani we aim to explore alternative computational models that enable further energy scaling by abandoning the deterministic requirement of today s computing systems these approaches will be particularly effective in the realization of cognitive functions such as recognition decision making and learning these functions are gaining rapid importance in a world that is infused with sensing modalities and in need of efficient information extraction qian my research focuses on the experimental design and statistical methods for developing mobile health interventions in particular i aim to develop efficient methods to utilize wearable data in order to answer the question of when where and under what context should a mobile health intervention be delivered one of the projects i will be focusing on in the coming year is a collaboration with professor pathik wadhwa from the uci school of medicine and other colleagues where we aim to develop just in time adaptive interventions for reducing stress among pregnant women and women of childbearing age this project involves building a prediction algorithm for detecting real time stress designing a micro randomized trial to collect data and constructing the algorithm to deliver the interventions in an optimal way on a more personal note what is your new year s resolution and is there anything from your bucket list you hope to cross off in 2022 epstein yikes big question i picked back up trail running this fall and did a few races for the first time in a while so my big goal there is to stick with staying active imani after two years of pandemic and remote working i believe it is finally the time to explore the world i am so excited to use summertime to travel with my family as helen keller once said life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all qian i just had a newborn in the summer of 2021 one of my new year s resolutions is to spend more time with my son and my family to cherish the moments when he is so little and so adorable

list of resources including on campus groups here at uci we also list some nationwide organizations and books that focus on diversity and race in technology as well as spotlight some black leaders in computer science and engineering both on and off campus when we think about black history month we usually begin by acknowledging those who have come before us and who are often overlooked in our society says gregory diggs yang assistant director of the stacey nicholas office of access and inclusion oai we should always honor those trailblazers but we should also recognize those great contributors who are currently widening the trail and those who are just beginning down it created in 2014 oai is a joint office between ics and the henry samueli school of engineering focused on recruiting retaining and graduating talented students from historically excluded populations the following is not meant to be an exhaustive list stresses diggs yang but rather a starting point for reflection during black history month and a way to recognize current black visionaries and new pioneers i am excited to be acknowledging the current unsung heroes of black history as it is being made

engineering and in the information and computer sciences in the samueli school of engineering assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering tayloria adams studies the physical properties of stem cell and cancer cell populations using innovative microfluidic devices her projects use electric currents and cell motion to develop membrane capacitance and other measurable cellular properties as reliable label free biological markers she holds a patent for her discoveries and was a national science foundation nsf postdoctoral fellow and uci chancellor s advance postdoctoral fellow adams recently earned a prestigious nsf career award and an award from the university of california cancer research coordinating committee also she is working with a multidisciplinary team to develop a curriculum focused on the meaningful engagement of minoritized students in the classroom this nsf funded grant led by pheather r harris director of uci s california alliance for minority participation is cutting edge and explores the environmental factors causing minoritized students to leave stem adams is also highly engaged in activities to increase the number of black high school undergraduate and graduate students pursuing stem fields black history month is very important to me says adams it s a chance for reflection on the strength of my ancestors which i channel into my research teaching and service i strive to be my ancestors wildest dreams and to influence the next generation of black engineers also in the samueli school of engineering assistant professor of biomedical engineering timothy downing is leading a team of interdisciplinary researchers working to uncover the molecular and physical principles of epigenome replication the project is funded through a 3 million nsf grant for research that seeks to better understand the dynamic nature of the epigenome which will open new possibilities for cellular engineering the award will also support activities that broaden participation in science among high schoolers and undergraduates including students from underrepresented groups in addition downing received 2 million in funding for a 2019 new innovator award with this work he aims to shed light on how mechanical cues integrate with and give rise to disease driving epigenetic mutations ultimately leading to the discovery of better treatment options for cancer patients black history month is a great opportunity for us all to reflect and remember to bring our full self into the edges of the social networks that we live and work in says downing it represents the idea that there s space in our society for everyone to exist and participate authentically when we do that incredible things happen in the school of ics assistant professor of informatics roderic crooks studies the intersections of race technology and public life his current project explores how community organizers in working class communities of color use data for activist projects even as they dispute the proliferation of data intensive technologies in education law enforcement financial services and other vital sites of civic concern the pursuit of science including information and computer sciences does not exempt anyone from participation in the complex dynamics and shared histories of anti black racism in the united states and across the world says crooks we are all deeply enmeshed in systems of power and privilege that benefit some and harm others based on interlocking hierarchies of citizenship wealth race class gender sexuality and disability i am encouraged by the increased willingness of our students to name these dynamics and to consider the study of structural oppression central to the work we do in ics also in the school of ics is ian harris who has been a professor in the department of computer science since 2004 his research interests include the design of secure hardware and software systems and the application of natural language understanding to security and design his current projects include the detection of phone based social engineering attacks the formalization of natural language specifications and the development of a cyber test range to evaluate the security of iot systems he is also leading a team of students participating in the mitre embedded capture the flag competition joni ricks oddie is the first full time director of the uci center for statistical consulting and is also director of the institute for clinical and translational sciences icts biostatistics epidemiology and research design berd unit by managing both ricks oddie who earned her ph d in epidemiology from ucla in 2012 has streamlined processes so the two groups operate in sync as a one stop shop for the uci community and affiliated organizations needing to collaborate with a statistician she works with a variety of organizations including chapman university and children s hospital of orange county and has organized many training sessions and workshops at uci she has a heart for working on diversity equity and inclusion dei related projects and is currently helping to lead the icts black thriving initiative strategic plan as well as working with faculty in the statistics department to expose underrepresented minority urm middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science every few decades our nation has a crisis of conscience as it pertains to its black citizenry says ricks oddie we change policies enact new laws develop diversity initiatives and commit to do better unfortunately each time the situation or crisis that initiated the movement ultimately gets forgotten and society moves on to some other more fashionable issue i truly hope this time we do not get weary in well doing and are able to sustain our commitment to making uci a place where black people are truly able to thrive and be their authentic selves shani murray 4 ics professors among 7 uci

wellness approach is giant leap in patient control improved outcomes irvine calif feb 15 2022 the university of california irvine today announced the launch of the institute for precision health an endeavor that marries uci s powerhouse health sciences engineering machine learning artificial intelligence clinical genomics and data science capabilities to deliver the most effective health and wellness strategy for each individual person and in doing so confronts the linked challenges of health equity and the high cost of care the institute will bring a multifaceted integrated approach to what many call the next great advancement in healthcare precision medicine collects patient data history exams demographics molecular and diagnostic tests and uses the power of computer algorithms predictive modeling and ai to develop personalized treatment and lifelong health maintenance plans what we re doing at the institute for precision health is perhaps the most important step we ll take in this generation to improve health and well being said steve a n goldstein m d ph d faap uci s vice chancellor for health affairs the ever evolving capabilities of the iph herald a future of personally tailored care that fundamentally alters the healthcare landscape to place the patient at the center and in control in the past individuals were treated based on approaches thought to be best for groups of patients now we begin the iph epoch of patient centric care designed to continuously improve the health of the individual within their community even as new knowledge accrues whereby rights incentives transparency and control remain the purview of the patient goldstein added iph is an ecosystem for collaboration across disciplines that comprises seven areas smart statistics machine learning artificial intelligence designs software to integrate and analyze health records molecular data and observations the unit is led by daniel gillen professor and chair of statistics and zhaoxia yu associate professor of statistics a2ir applied artificial intelligence research designs practical solutions to real world clinical problems for cost effective value based care it is led by dr peter chang assistant professor of radiological sciences a3 applied analytics and artificial intelligence brings solutions to inpatient ambulatory and community settings and supports pilot applications the area is led by dr daniel chow assistant professor of radiological sciences precision omics generates analyzes and applies genomic proteomic and chemical data it is led by suzanne sandmeyer professor of biological chemistry and leslie thompson donald bren professor of psychiatry human behavior and neurobiology behavior collaboratory for health and wellness powered by syntropy houses the dynamic analytics platforms and patient controlled data at the core of the iph ecosystem the group is led by tom andriola vice chancellor for information technology and data and kai zheng professor of informatics deployable health equity employs machine learning artificial intelligence into communities to create solutions narrowing the disparities gap in the health and well being of vulnerable populations the unit is led by dr dan cooper professor of pediatrics and associate vice chancellor for clinical translational research and bernadette boden albala professor and director of the program in public health and founding dean of the planned school of population public health education and training with leadership from each area brings courses seminars certificates and degrees in statistics machine learning artificial intelligence omics and bioinformatics to practitioners and students because the disciplines included in iph already existed at uci goldstein noted it was in many ways only a small step to join them together and build a resource across campus the synergy created however is no small matter this is the giant leap for healthcare it s glaringly clear that precision health is how to increase the quality of care to decrease the cost of care by both improving how it s delivered and matching cost to value and to deliver quality healthcare to the underserved he said adding that the institute s success will be measured by improvements in individual and community health a major goal is revealing new approaches to tackle ailments that lack successful therapies for many diseases especially neurodegenerative ones like alzheimer s parkinson s and even huntington s where the causal gene is known there are simply no treatments available that change their course we re excited because we know that with precision health we have the potential to define diseases better understand them better and treat them far better said thompson iph co director we expect major breakthroughs while the vision idea for iph has long been in the works the covid 19 pandemic was a beta test demonstrating how rapidly critical medical needs could be addressed in early 2020 with elements of iph in place uci clinicians biomedical and computer scientists and public health experts joined forces to create an ai driven tool to assess the critical care needs of covid patients this app based tool the covid vulnerability index demonstrated that a data driven approach coupled with world class clinical therapeutics could help yield the best outcomes for individuals we couldn t have had a proof of concept with higher stakes than the pandemic said tom andriola iph co director we saw in real time how mobilizing our capabilities to analyze health data and make customized decisions could complement leading edge clinical treatments to save lives and reduce hospital stays additionally there is an explosion of data in healthcare and we re still only using a small fraction in decision making he added iph is including not only data from traditional healthcare settings but also the data coming from a new generation of empowered health consumers who are tracking and managing their own health journey the plan is for iph to have a brick and mortar home on the uci campus that will serve as a hub for educating data informed clinicians to practice at the top of their licenses a site for the infrastructure to facilitate translational research a place for community outreach and a venue for commercial collaborations already industry leaders such as syntropy and mitre and community partners such as children s health of orange county and the va long beach healthcare system are working with iph to leverage uci s capabilities and commitment as a fair broker for health data placing individuals first for patients the message is that uci s institute for precision health is the future of your care and well being goldstein said for the research community iph is a wide open opportunity for discoveries that matter for the business community iph is ready to partner to advance new cost effective care and for the philanthropic community the folks

on learning representations iclr 2022 a globally renowned conference on cutting edge research in deep learning their first paper advances solutions to a fundamental problem in information theory while the second introduces a new model for general purpose lossless data compression understanding compression feasibilityin towards empirical sandwich bounds on the rate distortion function mandt and his ph d student yibo yang quantify the fundamental hardness of compressing real world data such as images if you ve ever paid attention to the file size of jpeg images you may notice how certain kinds of images take up more storage than others of the same dimensions explains yang it turns out that with information theory we can quantify the inherent compressibility of a given type of data using a quantity called the rate distortion function and no data compression algorithm can beat the theoretical performance limit implied by it therefore knowing the rate distortion function of the data being compressed can really help researchers assess and improve their compression algorithms although the rate distortion function can be worked out mathematically for a few simple data distributions establishing it for other data in general especially for big data of practical interest has been an open research problem with this work yang and mandt move closer to this goal by developing a machine learning algorithm that can estimate the rate distortion function of potentially high dimensional types of data such as images and voice recordings it was really exciting to see the algorithm i sketched out on paper actually work on real world data ranging from natural images and speech spectrograms to data from particle physics says yang such data would have posed an insurmountable computation challenge to the previously known method an algorithm from the 1970s still the general problem is not quite solved and i hope this work opens up new possibilities for future research toward lossless compression with machine learningin hbo s television series silicon valley a group of hackers develops a fundamentally new lossless compression algorithm it turns out that fiction is not too far from reality in a recent collaboration involving anji liu a ph d student at ucla and liu s advisor computer science professor guy van den broeck mandt contributed to a new general purpose compression approach lossless compression with probabilistic circuits published as a spotlight at iclr 2022 the idea of lossless compression is very similar to that of morse code where we abbreviate frequent letters like e by a single dit and rare letters by three dits this leads to an optimally short representation of the message says mandt the key to lossless compression is hence to reliably predict how frequently any given symbol occurs for simple data we can just count but for more complicated data like images we need predictive machine learning models while most neural compression employs popular deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks the present work uses a fundamentally different niche machine learning approach called probabilistic circuits pcs with the help of these models the researchers could dramatically accelerate relevant computations that play a key role in data compression as a result their pc based de compression algorithm runs 5 20 times faster than neural compression algorithms that achieve similar bitrates this work says mandt is a great example of how curiosity driven fundamental research can culminate in surprising unforeseeable applications that would never have been discovered otherwise shani murray uci news uci researchers receive state funding to study pandemic forecasting uci news uci s graduate programs

researchers had developed a hybrid human machine framework for ai systems that can complement human expertise from chatbots that answer tax questions to algorithms that drive autonomous vehicles and dish out medical diagnoses artificial intelligence undergirds many aspects of daily life creating smarter more accurate systems requires a hybrid human machine approach according to researchers at the university of california irvine in a study published this month in proceedings of the national academy of sciences they present a new mathematical model that can improve performance by combining human and algorithmic predictions and confidence scores the seeds for this cutting edge work by researchers in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics and the school of social sciences were first planted decades ago this collaboration started with padhraic smyth chancellor s professor in the computer science and statistics departments and mark steyvers a professor in the department of cognitive sciences padhraic smyth left and mark steyvers stand outside of donald bren hall steve zylius uci one of the really nice things about uci is that there s a lot of interdisciplinary activity says smyth whose research is supported through a qualcomm faculty award there is this culture of collaboration so cognitive scientists come to bren hall to attend our ai and machine learning talks and we go to their talks in fact smyth and steyvers have been meeting periodically since the early 2000s we d chat over coffee about our projects says smyth we speak different languages but we re both interested in intelligence just from different perspectives computer science emphasizes artificial and cognitive sciences emphasizes natural and there s a lot of overlap so when the national science foundation nsf put out a call for research related to how humans and ai work together smyth and steyvers put together two proposals both of which were funded in 2019 one grant focuses on hybrid human algorithm predictions exploring how to balance effort accuracy and perceived autonomy the other grant is an assessment of machine learning algorithms in the wild this work led to the recently published pnas paper bayesian modeling of human ai complementarity as announced by uci the paper was co authored by steyvers and smyth along with heliodoro tejeda a graduate student in cognitive sciences and gavin kerrigan a ph d student in computer science funded by the hpi research center at uci the grants have led to other papers co authored by steyvers and smyth as well they worked with kerrigan on combining human predictions with model probabilities via confusion matrices and calibration a paper appearing in proceedings for the thirty fifth conference on neural information processing systems neurips 2021 and they worked with computer science ph d students disi ji and robby logan on active bayesian assessment of blackbox classifiers a paper appearing in proceedings for the thirty fifth aaai conference on artificial intelligence this line of work is part of a larger collaboration with about five or six ph d students says smyth markelle kelly one of those students is markelle kelly a computer science graduate student who last summer received a fellowship through uci s steckler center for responsible ethical and accessible technology create this year kelly was awarded a fellowship through the irvine initiative in ai law and society both the center and initiative are helping facilitate this interdisciplinary work the human machine collaboration between the cognitive sciences and computer science departments explores questions about how people and machines can work together as a team says kelly who is currently investigating how humans and ai can understand the strengths and weaknesses of each other to better delegate tasks by working alongside cognitive science researchers i can better understand theories about the human side of this problem and incorporate these ideas into potential solutions the resulting cross disciplinary experiments and findings are founded on a much more nuanced perspective than if only machine learning experts were involved smyth agrees computer science historically has been a little bit averse to getting humans in the loop but i think ai and machine learning researchers now realize that although our algorithms have been developed and tested in our labs for a decade or two without attracting much attention they are now being widely applied to address real problems involving real people he says as a consequence getting students early in their career involved in these kinds of interesting projects and in discussions related to how ai is being used will help ensure ai is used

why the healthcare industry is a field that can constantly evolve to support the ever changing needs of patients one of these technologies is data science which ty shao believes can spur beneficial discoveries and change in healthcare shao is a graduate student and program ambassador of uci s master of data science program and plans to utilize her data science education in healthcare because the medical field is really close to her heart my dad passed away from advanced kidney cancer when i was young when he initially started feeling discomfort doctors did not immediately suspect that it was cancer since he was a relatively healthy man so by the time he was officially diagnosed it was already too late as he had entered the later stages of cancer says shao this experience is what motivates shao to spend her time in the mds program and beyond participating in cancer research to impact and revolutionize the healthcare industry i intend to use the tools of data science to help expedite life saving diagnoses to cancer patients and improve overall patient care says shao i am interested in working on cancer research throughout my career as a data scientist so that i can help other families who are also afflicted by this disease her passion and interests in the medical field extend beyond her research and professional goals as well i also enjoy exercising and working out because i think it s incredibly important to be active and to maintain a healthy lifestyle the experiences i ve had throughout my life encouraged me to prioritize and value my physical health says shao before joining the mds program shao turned her love for math into an academic pursuit at the university of california riverside she majored in statistics because it s a discipline that has many real world applications and in her undergraduate studies shao learned about the field of data science shao knew uci would be the perfect school for furthering her interests in this industry being one of the few professional programs in the uc system that offered a graduate degree solely in the field of data science uci easily became my top choice for the school where i wanted to conduct my graduate studies shao says i always had an affinity toward the uc system having grown up in southern california since it is both close to home and offers a great educational experience shao enjoys her experience in the mds program she says the coursework taught by her professors is enriching and beneficial to her development as a data scientist she also loves learning alongside her peers i have also enjoyed meeting and bonding with the classmates in my cohort who also share my passion for data science she says from this program i am hoping to gain the necessary skills and connections that will be deeply integrated into my career in addition to achieving her professional goals in the mds program shao hopes to leverage her ambassadorship position to encourage women to pursue studies and careers in the data science field she says that in her experience as a woman studying statistics she is part of a minority group and her male classmates often overshadow her to shao it s important that more women enter data science and other stem fields and bring in unique perspectives that do not exist in male dominated spaces women have so much to offer to the industry and can provide additional perspectives and approaches to problems that are not considered by their male peers says shao as an ambassador for the mds program i am hoping to provide women with more exposure to the field of data science and to encourage them to also become involved in the development and advancement of this discipline with a number of ambitions and commitments life can be stressful so shao shared some activities she likes to do to de stress and have fun with her family and friends outside of school i enjoy cooking and baking as these are activities i find to be extremely therapeutic and rewarding says shao food is something that connects all types of people and brings different cultures together i love showing my appreciation towards my close friends and family members by making meals or baking delicious treats for them as the spring quarter begins that also means shao s first year in the mds program nears its end and her second year will begin soon shao wants to make the most of her education by gaining professional working experience and applying what she has learned to a practical real world setting from there i am hoping to acquire enough experience and knowledge so that i am eventually able to make significant contributions to cancer research she says i would like to establish my career as a data scientist in the healthcare field as it is one that i am immensely passionate about

county and other organizations develop grant proposals calculate sample sizes interpret data and design research databases in the deforest park neighborhood of north long beach however the wife and mother of two young children is better known as a community advocate she was recently recognized by assembly member mike gipson as the 2021 woman of the year and she has long helped local residents stay engaged and empowered over the years she has served on the north long beach neighborhood alliance uptown property and business improvement district pbid and citizens police complaint commission cpcc and she is currently chair of the long beach planning commission tackling complex issues such as affordable housing now as ricks oddie campaigns for long beach city council in district 9 her

homelessness economic development and small business recovery public health parks and open spaces diversity equity and inclusion and public safety assembly member mike gipson named dr joni ricks oddie shown here with her husband and two children 2021 woman of the year for california assembly district 64 professional and personal perspectivespublic health is one area in particular that spotlights the interconnected nature of ricks oddie s professional and personal experiences part of my campaign revolves around public health outreach to minority communities and marginalized communities says ricks oddie i want to lead conversations around health equity and funding of public health programs at the city level the pandemic has really highlighted the need for more structural funding for our health department and with my background in statistics and epidemiology i want to bring a more data driven lens to how we make decisions yet ricks oddie isn t only about the numbers as highlighted in a march 7 facebook post about the birth of her daughter chloe the issue of health equity is also personal for her in the post she recounts how she gave birth to her second child in a car outside the hospital after having been sent home two hours earlier a situation that likely led to life threatening medical complications that left ricks oddie in need of surgery a few weeks later as a black woman i m acutely aware that black babies face a higher than normal infant mortality rate and that black mothers face a higher than normal mortality rate after birth these differences are rooted in the burden that black mothers face due to systematic racial bias she posted as a researcher and academic i deal with data and statistics every day on that day my daughter could easily have become a statistic in the worst possible way in chloe s honor this women s history month i d like to bring greater awareness and respect to those mothers particularly black mothers who literally risk their lives to give birth wrote ricks oddie in a facebook post for her daughter s first birthday ricks oddie goes on to say that this experience was part of her motivation to run for city council one of the reasons i m running for city council is to bring my professional and personal perspective on women s health health equity public health and community health to my work on behalf of our city she is sharing her story to build awareness and to bring a name and a voice to some of the complex challenges facing the city and to encourage others to share their stories as well she credits the black infant health program in long beach with providing her a safe space to process her experience thinking about our healthcare system in totality insurance access care representation and the issues around implicit bias is difficult because these are all things you can t necessarily prove because there are so many dynamics was race a contributing factor these are hard conversations but they re conversations that need to happen data driven solutionsat the same time ricks oddie wants to ensure that any policy changes introduced are not only supported by the data but also tracked and evaluated to properly evaluate programs in the city we need to attach appropriate metrics to assess whether changes made are even working she says i want to advocate for the creation of an office of data and evaluation which would help city departments and staff figure out what data is out there to support a particular position or program change ricks oddie s unique skill set would allow her to help identify appropriate milestones and metrics for policies and then effectively package and visualize them for presentations to the city council and other strategic partners in the city and this approach could be applied to everything from healthcare to homelessness for example she knows from her work with various organizations that it takes an average of 17 touches to persuade someone who is homeless to agree to accept help a lot of community members get frustrated when nothing happens after they make just one call but people have rights you have to develop trust with people and that takes time and resources gathering and understanding the data helps quantify the time and resources needed while also providing important context for continued community engagement from a policy standpoint we really have to think about what resources we provide our health department our social services department and our police department she says because when people call about issues around loitering somebody camping on public property or issues around mental health all of that connects a lot of city departments she stresses the need to manage these different entities at a holistic level while also educating the public about the role they play in helping to address various issues ready to hit the ground runningof the nine neighborhood associations in district 9 ricks oddie has been endorsed by eight association presidents i ve worked with them for the last decade so they trust my opinion and know that i ll be somebody who will always have an open door policy with them and a listening ear she has also been endorsed by both the previous councilmember and by current councilmember rex richardson who is running for mayor they also know that i m somebody who will fiercely advocate for our community i already have a lot of relationships going in which will allow me to hit the ground running she says and while her professional background brings a high level of analytical skills and expertise to the table it s her ability to apply those skills in support policies that will actually improve people s daily lives that matters i tell people i m raising my family here and i want them to live in a community that they re proud of where it feels like their city and their city leaders care about their well being shani murray applications open for new uci summer biostatistics

will be offering a two week session titled data data analytics theory applications from july 25 to aug 5 high school students will be on campus monday through friday from 9 a m to 4 p m exploring the foundations of data science with real world hands on projects computer science is more than just programming the whole idea behind the summer academy is to offer a selection of courses to help high school students explore the various areas and topics that comprise the ever changing and growing field of computing explains computer science professor magda el zarki the director of the academy leading this effort we re starting off with this one course on data analytics it is a great way to launch the program given the tremendous interest that students have in data it s the big thing these days camp attendees will spend their days in the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci learning about data science methods and concepts through hands on projects using anonymized health data from actual patients the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci mornings will start with lessons from professor babak shahbaba of uci s department of statistics or from professor sam behseta of cal state fullerton s department of mathematics they will be teaching students how to collect process summarize and visualize data after a daily lunch break highly qualified and trained uci graduate and undergraduate students will lead small teams working on projects related to actual datasets often drawn for biological and medical sciences the teams will make predictions using statistical models test scientific hypotheses using statistical inference techniques and make decisions under uncertainty by applying statistical thinking for the students it will be exciting to work with actual datasets and see what it s like to make sense from databases comprising a jumble of numbers and more says el zarki students will learn how to manipulate the data make the models analyze their results and present it in a way that illustrates certain interesting conclusions it will be an eye opener for a lot of kids students will also get to tour the campus visit research labs in the school s departments of computer science informatics and statistics and explore career pathways in the many related fields of computing interested students must apply online by may 6 2022 the application is short but does require the name title and email address of a teacher principal or school administrator who when contacted can submit a letter of recommendation also by the may 6 deadline there is no application fee and the 2 500 program cost covers lunches snacks and all materials required ics will provide laptops with all the software needed for the course the first cohort will likely be around 30 students the plan is for the ics summer academy to grow in offerings and cohort size the goal for next year is to offer three or four courses eventually building up to around six to eight courses by 2025 serving up to 250 students each year i m very positive about this effort for the future because i think it s very different from anything else out there says el zarki we already have faculty really interested in covering other areas the focus of future sessions might include security game development the internet of things iot ai and machine learning quantum computing and more there might also be more advanced sessions on certain topics for those interested in learning more about a particular field the goal of the summer academy is to help students explore and get a better understanding of what it means to be a computer scientist and the exciting careers that one can pursue being one says el zarki we want to give them a good sense of the diversity and vastness of the field of computing all the areas of expertise and knowledge that it encompasses and that make it so exciting shani murray dr joni ricks oddie applies data driven lens

discussing everything from chocolate milk to dating apps and referencing shows like parks and recreation and rupaul s drag race an open access book co authored by mine dogucu removes barriers to learning bayesian statistics and finds new ways to engage readers i sincerely believe that a generation of students will cite this book as inspiration for their use of and love for bayesian statistics says duke university professor yue jiang in his review of bayes rules an introduction to applied bayesian modeling crc press 2022 this is perhaps the most engaging introductory statistics textbook i have ever read that was the goal when mine dogucu an assistant professor of teaching in uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics started collaborating with alicia a johnson and miles q ott on their bayes rules book which is freely available online or can be purchased from crc press as a hard copy paperback or e book a preprint by the authors outlines their commitment to accessibility and inclusivity while writing the book we wanted to make bayesian statistics more accessible for undergraduate students everywhere particularly novice learners says dogucu and for diverse groups of learners from different backgrounds to accomplish this they deliberately included a wide variety of entertaining examples and exercises as joseph k blitzstein of harvard university notes in his foreword you will encounter a vibrant sample of applications in this book ranging from weather prediction to lgbtq anti discrimination laws and from who calls soda pop or calls pop soda to how to classify penguin species most importantly careful study of this book will empower you to conduct thoughtful bayesian analyses for the data and applications you care about not surprisingly dogucu herself first became passionate about statistics after seeing its real world use in an application area she cared about what first sparked your interest in statistics i was a math major in a small liberal arts college statistics back then was not as popular especially for the small school and there was no statistics department per se it was within the math department i decided to take a statistics class and i remember very well the moment i decided i wanted to study more statistics we were working on a dataset about hurricane katrina about housing losses and damages and i was so impressed i thought wow we can actually use math to answer useful questions of course useful means something different for everyone but for me it means helping people so using statistics to understand problems impacting people was so fascinating to me and that s when i decided i needed to take more steps to study this why is there now a need for books on bayesian statistics targeted at the undergraduate level bayesian statistics itself is not new but traditionally it has not been taught widely there are many reasons for this one reason is that it is computationally challenging second in the past there were more criticisms surrounding the subjectivity of bayesian methods it s becoming more popular because we now have greater computing power and the scientific community or part of the community has reevaluated subjectivity more schools are offering a bayesian course now another reason is that there are two big paradigms in statistics one is frequentist and the other is bayesian so if we don t teach bayesian we are not really giving our students the full picture of different approaches to statistical analysis also there s this key value that is almost always reported in scientific studies the benchmark p less than 0 05 the p value is overused and often misused in studies experts argue that when writing a whole scientific study it shouldn t all come down to just the p value and one of the suggestions in the field of statistics is to make more room for bayesian methods the american statistical association put out a statement on p values and it starts with a quote about why colleges teach p 0 05 we teach it because it s what we do we do it because it s what we teach so if we actually teach bayesian methods that s one way to help break that cycle it brings an additional perspective to statistical analyses beyond the p value we have to prepare our students for that how is uci s department of statistics preparing students i recently co authored a preprint on the current state of undergraduate bayesian education and we were looking at courses across the nation in the highest ranked 100 universities and 50 liberal arts colleges we found 46 institutions that offer a bayesian course but most of these were elective courses only four institutions required bayesian statistics and uci is very special because we were one of them we offer an undergraduate course every winter stats 115 introduction to bayesian data analysis and it s a required course for our data science program so it s not surprising that this course is accessible at the undergraduate level at uci we have many famous bayesians in our department including hal stern wes johnson michele guindani veronica berrocal and babak shahbaba so ics is just a good bayesian place and we re also collaborating with other schools for example as part of a recent nsf grant cal state fullerton will start offering a new course like ours you wanted readers to find people like themselves in the book how did you achieve that goal so we assume that our readers will have diverse backgrounds because we started with our own students and our own students have diverse backgrounds but at the same time we aimed for this book to be accessible to everyone you don t necessarily have to be an undergraduate student we wanted it to be relevant to different cultures for instance there s an example taken from u s elections with presidential candidates going through primaries although other political systems might have primaries it s not universal so to use that example we had to give the context so we tried really hard to read the book from different perspectives to make it as accessible as possible to a diverse group of learners from different backgrounds what is one of your favorite examples from the book one part of the book that i really like is the statistical model evaluation and the reason for that is because at least in the books i used to read as a student myself model evaluation mostly focused on statistical numbers for example some model evaluation criteria that we would calculate but in our book in addition to that we also focus on ethical aspects of statistical models like is the model biased how were the data collected how could the model impact individuals or society at large i really like that this is included in the book how do you think the field of statistics might change based on greater diversity and inclusion this book is not the only thing that s going to make our field more diverse i think it might create small changes like a reader might see one example in the book that they connect to or an instructor might be inspired to make their materials more accessible but these are all small water drops in the bucket of course our aspiration is to have a bigger impact on the field but that usually comes from institutional changes like providing access to more opportunities for students in addition to affordability you also made the content accessible for people with visual disabilities yes we made sure to use color blind friendly color palettes in addition the online version of the book supports alternate text that is image descriptions read by screen readers alternate text not only makes images accessible to the blind and visually impaired but also to everyone because for instance they show up in internet searches to the best of my knowledge bayes rules is the first statistics e textbook that supports alternate text and you were deliberate in whom you cited in the book and how you cited them why unfortunately the way citations work is that usually we cite people who are already cited a lot we don t go out of our way at least i didn t before writing this book to pay attention to why i was citing someone so in preparation of the book we tried to read more authors from diverse groups to make sure we were including different points of view and that s not just for the book but to benefit us as educators by reading more then we wanted to make sure the book captured all those different scholars we also paid close attention to citing trans authors correctly actually my first quarter here at uci i cited an article on transgender scholars in my blog on inclusivity before even realizing tess informatics professor theresa tanenbaum was here in my school but basically we tried really hard to check their websites so we didn t just rely on how other people cited them finally what informed your decision to make the book open access this was of course a mutual decision with my co authors and their reasons might be similar or different but from my perspective textbooks are unaffordable as a student i was on a textbook scholarship from my school so i could buy books through that luckily here at uci we even have students who have food insecurity i wouldn t want to say to them don t buy food buy my own book especially considering that students actually contributed to the book maybe not by writing it but i ve been basically using some drafts of it for three years my students found typos and helped me see what examples were most effective and i learned from their responses to the material so they were actually part of the writing process which makes it unreasonable to ask them to pay for it i don t know the exact numbers but hundreds of people are accessing the online book on a daily basis from many different countries so it s been a great decision if students cannot access the book they cannot learn from it so accessibility was our number one goal i don t think a print book would have reached as many readers shani

california r users group socal rug a local forum of people who use the statistical programming language r bella feng sep dadsetan and john preach were the featured panelists along with ryan benz the three of them shared their experiences working in the data science industry focusing on their career development over the years career growth bella feng the first question of the night was how one can stand out at work and form positive relationships with their colleagues bella feng head of statistical programming and clinical trial data science at biotechnology company eqrx started the discussion by encouraging everyone to be engaged and open minded feng mentioned that she got her first job because of a presentation she did at a statistical analysis system sas conference to feng it s important to build strong relationships with those around you because they can pay off in the long run in your career sep dadsetan sep dadsetan who is the executive director of real world evidence analytics at healthcare and artificial intelligence company concertai agreed with feng and emphasized the significance of knowing the structure of your company and how you interact with your colleagues to understand the impact of your role it s really important to send an email introduce yourself and try to connect with others and see what they re working on dadsetan said i think through that you ll see where you can contribute and how the company is organized john peach in addition to networking john peach principal data scientist at cloud technology company oracle and member of socal rug says using data to inform decisions and be customer focused while keeping the company vision in mind can improve your work performance and relationships with your clients for data scientists one of the big parts of the job is to be a trusted adviser your job is to help the people that make decisions make the decision that s based around what the data is telling them as opposed to what their gut says peach said make sure that what you re going to do has some real impact along the way and you should be able to identify everything that you re doing and what the impact is going to be like for the customer biotechnology company seer s director of data science and socal rug member ryan benz led the latter half of the panel s discussion on career growth with a lighting round to discuss career growth and pitfalls ryan benz benz and the panelists noted that being curious dependable and a problem solver and having people skills are signs that an employee may be ready to be promoted when asked to share some examples of what might set back professionally they said being indecisive and having a limited or negative mindset may hurt you to avoid stumbling in your career peach re emphasized looking at the bigger picture and advised performing at the level you want to be promoted to and taking ownership of your work management vs individual contributor career tracksthe panel discussion shifted to focus on two career tracks being a manager versus being an individual contributor peach described one of the differences between being a manager and an individual contributor being the scope and type of their responsibilities while individual contributors manage themselves and are responsible for their projects a manager s role entails managing people such as overseeing personnel and creating teams in that sense being a manager is almost like being a parent according to feng dadseten added that good managers understand the scope of their own knowledge and skills and will help you find the support you need if they cannot personally provide certain resources the panelists then discussed how one knows if being a manager or an individual contributor is the right role for them understanding how you want to manage your impact at work is one thing to consider to give an example peach noted that being a technical leader allows you to have an impact throughout your organization but your impact is still focused on your area of expertise on the other hand a manager will have a broader impact on both projects and the people they re guiding as you re going up the ic individual contributor track ask yourself if you are enjoying the project management aspects more than you re enjoying the technical hands on work peach said that s a good indication that maybe taking on some management role would be interesting to you being a manager also gives you more influence in the workplace which is one of the things feng enjoys i really like the influence part said feng adding that she championed the use of r in a previous role but was unsuccessful because she was not a decision maker so once there was a reorganization my initiative was killed because everything was outsourced but right now i m not an individual contributor and more like the decision maker so i can decide dadsetan said that as you progress in your career it s good to take note of what you like and dislike and what you re good at and not good at because these are all factors that come into play when deciding what role you find best fits you i think it s important to realize that it s not a decision you have to make now and can never go back to ever dadsetan said there s relatively fluidity balancing personal professional lifecareer advancement inevitably comes with more expectations and responsibilities that can even interfere with your personal life benz said that managing stress and experiencing burnout are not talked about enough even in school so the panel discussion ended with everyone sharing how they handle the demands of their careers dadsetan acknowledged that you might hit the ground running straight out of college but it s imperative you don t overwork yourself and start drawing lines as needed as an individual you have to balance being fresh out of school wanting to make a good impression wanting to do your best so that might require you to work overtime dadsetan said but it s also really important to be listening to your body and know what it is that you want to prioritize in your life and take stock of what matters to you setting boundaries at work is also a way that feng maintains a healthy work life balance in the past she juggled a number of roles and responsibilities all at once at work causing her to burn out feng said attending a weeklong retreat and connecting with herself without electronics helped her recover and be more in tune with her body another way to prevent burnout is by learning to separate your personal and professional life it s a job it s not my identity peach said for a very long time my self identity was tied to what i was doing making that separation has helped a lot it can also help to find purpose in your career so that you are moving up learning new things and specializing rather than being stuck doing the same tasks or trying to do everything at once i personally am much better if i know that i m having personal growth i m learning a lot peach said focus on where your talents are as you go up in your career you re going to be more and more specialized in what you re known for so focus on doing that as opposed to doing everything karen phan don t think you can learn bayesian statistics think again with bayes rules qu elected international statistical institute member quick links news archive

expo held in the new state of the art interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb the event was a culmination of months of hard work offering the students the opportunity to present projects completed for undergraduate capstone courses in informatics computer science and data science as well as for the butterworth product development competition project sponsors and students alike look forward to this annual opportunity to highlight projects they ve labored over throughout the year students presenting their work in the iseb lobby at the ics project expo partnering with industry the expo really ties together the four foundational elements of engagement that our programs offer project experience entrepreneurship mentorship and opportunities for internship says jason king senior associate director of corporate relations in ics the expo benefits project sponsors looking to recruit and showcases all the great work of our students these ics undergraduates spent anywhere from 10 to 20 weeks experiencing hands on learning working on real world projects collaborating with industry partners peter colligan a senior technology executive for the sap s 4hana industry cloud was one of 40 industry professionals in attendance at the expo speaking of sap s goal of helping to accelerate collaboration between academia startups and industry colligan stresses the importance of these types of events i get a chance to directly and informally interact with student teams and talk about the engineering skills and projects they care about those discussions can sometimes go deeper where professors themselves step in and get a chance to highlight and validate ideas and common challenges with industry practitioners he continues very realistic and concrete outcomes have come out of this such as ideas for future capstone projects full time employment work or joint industry research initiatives jason king thanks the corporate partners gaining real world experiencerecognizing the tremendous benefits of providing opportunities for practical application and industry engagement the department of informatics has been offering a capstone course for more than a dozen years it is now a graduation requirement for informatics and ics has also added elective undergraduate capstone courses for computer science and data science majors presenting your work professionally in a conference like event is a very valuable experience for our undergraduate students says computer science professor sergio gago masague who launched the computer science capstone course in 2020 i personally enjoyed watching students and sponsors engaging in very interesting discussions about projects and ideas for future work one of the top computer science capstone projects leveraged artificial intelligence to create a personalized recommendation system for quick service restaurants qsrs for the ai driven personalized menu content for the qsr drive thu project students ezra hammond rieko konishi arian namavar and ryan sakuma partnered with delphi display systems they developed a machine learning system that presents relevant items to users based on their preferences and dietary restrictions to improve the drive thru experience they also presented their project and competed at the national capstone design conference in dallas texas on june 6 2022 the capstone project gave me the confidence that after my four years of education under the school of ics i am ready to tackle new and unfamiliar projects successfully and implement what i ve learned says namavar who graduated in june during the interviews i had with various companies i would always answer their questions with my experience with our ics capstone sponsor and project in mind which i think helped me secure an offer namavar will be working as a software developer at nisum the ics expo was also a great opportunity to present our project and take ownership of our result seeing the progress other students made was another aspect that made me proud of ics informatics lecturer darren denenberg was similarly impressed by the students progress noting that everyone was able to achieve something

it was a project i thought no one would be interested in and it ended up being one of the best groups best projects and they also went to dallas to compete in the national capstone conference professor denenberg left and ics dean marios right listen to students pitch their products informatics professor hadar ziv attended the conference with the audioscribe team and says they represented themselves and the school of ics very well they really held their own conducting multiple high quality presentations and enjoying their interactions with their peers and with capstone instructors from around the country however even students who don t have space in their schedule for a capstone course or conference or who aren t upperclassmen have opportunities for entrepreneurship thanks to the butterworth competition this product development competition is designed to encourage the creation of new technologies with the potential for commercialization this year s winning project leprendo was on display at the ics project expo letting participants view the online farmer s marketplace created by computer science major dylan riffle computer science and engineering major kanu chandra business administration major dan ta and psychological sciences major nina nguyen by developing our pitch deck and going through the competition we learned the importance of being able to combine the technical development of a product with business development and communicate this effectively says riffle the team will continue to develop leprendo over the summer we re firing on all cylinders and increasingly promoting the value of capstone projects showing why regional and national companies should be involved with these programs and the talent pipelines they offer says king our programs are

minor in statistics current course listings news seminars news seminar center for statistical consulting conference experience confirms competitive edge of ics capstone program july 25 2022 what are some of the benefits of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics aside from the fact that it s the only computing focused school in the uc system and happens to sit in the middle of silicon beach it also offers capstone courses that provide hands on experience in a practical real world environment the strength and importance of such programs was reiterated june 6 8 2022 when ics faculty students and staff attended the national capstone design conference in dallas texas i came away from the capstone design conference even more convinced that providing hands on practical experience is essential to prepare our students for life after college says informatics lecturer matthew bietz during his projects in human computer interaction capstone course students take all of the skills they have learned in ics classrooms and put them together in the context of a software development project these projects require students to balance real world priorities deadlines and resource constraints they have to understand client needs and figure out how to best meet them given their team s strengths and weaknesses he explains our capstone program gives our students a real competitive edge in the job market this year some of the top students from the ics undergraduate capstone program with course offerings for informatics computer science and data science majors traveled to dallas to present their projects at the same time ics faculty and staff learned about and shared best practices uci students taking a break from the conference to explore plano texas sharing best practicesone goal of the biennial capstone design conference is to provide a forum for sharing ideas it features sessions focused on how to engage industry partners bring in dollars for philanthropic support manage courses and so on the conference gave us the chance to find out what is working and not working at other schools learn about tools and techniques for organizing and teaching capstone courses and network with colleagues says bietz it also gave him the opportunity to share some best practices from ics collaborating with informatics professor hadar ziv who has been leading capstone courses in ics since 2009 bietz co authored a paper for the conference on empowering capstone students in client interactions they point out in the paper that most student training has been in classroom settings where the structure of tasks is well defined the expectations are clear and the instructor is an absolute authority they argue that a critical lesson gained from the capstone experience is learning how to have a productive disagreement with a client ziv also co authored a paper with colleagues from texas a m and from brazil on adapting scrum ceremonies in undergraduate capstone projects the paper talks about getting student teams to follow agile values and principles and scrum activities and best practices while acknowledging important differences between a scrum team in the real world and undergraduate students in a capstone course these were just two of the more than 30 papers and posters presented at the conference ziv also presented two workshop sessions in collaboration with uci alumnus david ochi director of the beall student design and butterworth product development competitions the workshops covered how to generate ideas and how to translate projects into startups ics had a strong showing at the conference not just by the number of papers posters workshops and other activities but also by a strong attendance and active engagement with all other attendees says ziv our presence was well noticed and well received jason king senior associate director of corporate relations in ics agreed noting that it was a win win situation we attended this conference hoping to take away some golden nuggets or gems learning from other institutions he compared it to being an athlete seeking out better competition during training if you truly want to grow and be the best soccer player you need to get outside of your region to compete against other players to raise that bar and this is a perfect example of that he explains this is the first time we ve gone outside of our region and it s only helping us grow now we re opening up those communication channels and people respect our feedback and vice versa presenting projects and networkingwhile half of the conference focused on best practices the other half focused on student engagement with students competing presenting and networking with their peers and also meeting with high school students interested in computer science and engineering our students who attended the conference were amazing says bietz presenting their projects in a competitive poster session was a great learning experience and they got great feedback from the judges and other attendees the conference also provided an opportunity for them to network with students from other schools meet representatives of tech companies and strengthen their bond with each other connecting with other students was a highlight for jessie chang a business information management major who presented her team s project canvas tools for teachers the tools she helped design aim to alleviate common challenges in the existing education model i enjoyed meeting new people the most there were so many different teams from different parts of the countries she says it was just really cool meeting them and learning about their projects she added that she learned a lot about engineering the conference seems more geared toward engineering students so it was a surprise to all of us that our projects were even accepted as it was all software king noted that the conference is making an effort to incorporate more computer science students and projects into its biennial event the capstone conference in dallas was a fantastic opportunity to showcase two quarters of hard work as well as engage with students and professors from all over the united states says software engineering major ellen kulla who presented the audioscribe cough diarization project with teammates alexis diaz jinli duan qiantai duan and yuan wang audioscribe developed in a capstone course taught by informatics lecturer darren denenberg analyzes different sounds for use in clinical research and healthcare settings the conference adds kulla really showed us how much students are able to accomplish as a group in a short period of time jason king front right with audioscribe team members another ics project presented was developed by computer science students ezra hammond rieko konishi arian namavar and ryan sakuma the students collaborated with delphi display systems in a capstone course taught by computer science professor sergio gago masague to develop a recommendation system for quick service restaurants qsrs my team had the opportunity to attend the conference and it was an amazing experience getting to represent the school of ics and interact with sponsors companies colleges and universities from all over the u s and canada says namavar their project ai driven personalized menu content for the qsr drive thru uses a machine learning system to present relevant items to users based on their preferences and dietary restrictions cultivating that competitive edge the capstone program is the one of the best things about ics showcasing the great work that s going on within the school from undergraduate students says king the program provides opportunities for internships and professional development helps students learn how to apply technical skills and use various project management and communication tools and lets them practice soft skills and networking in a real world environment we want to make sure we re using best practices when it comes to these offerings and that our program is on par if not better than other standout schools across the nation says king this

from july 11 through august 19 2022 twenty three students from around the u s came to uci for the newly launched irvine summer institute in biostatistics and undergraduate data science isi buds the institute is part of the summer institute in biostatistics program offered through the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid this year uci became only the 10th university in the nation to host this free six week summer training course aimed at addressing the growing need for biostatisticians and data scientists offered through the department of statistics in the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics the isi buds program provides not only training in the fundamentals of biostatistics data science and computing but also experience in conducting cutting edge biomedical research the main goal is to excite students about careers and graduate school in biostatistics says statistics professor vladimir minin who co directs the program with ics colleagues dan gillen babak shahbaba and mine dogucu careers in biostatistics are peculiar in the sense that a lot of them require a graduate degree so there s a need for more training in this area explains minin however biostatistics is rarely taught at the undergraduate level so many undergraduate students do not know about career opportunities in this area sarah schlund a senior at uc santa barbara double majoring in statistics and data science and in geography agrees i had been searching for an opportunity to gain experience in biostatistics prior to committing to a five year doctorate program in the field however such opportunities are few and far between she says isi buds offers the rare opportunity to gain biostatistics experience as an undergraduate and learn from the very impressive faculty at uci who have immense biostatistics knowledge and experience both in industry and academic research ics faculty members and the inaugural cohort of students for the irvine summer institute in biostatistics and undergraduate data science an impressive inaugural cohortthe inaugural cohort of students selected from more than 150 applications came from a wide variety of schools including the university of connecticut emory university montana state university the university of arizona university of michigan university of vermont and university of washington there was also a regional presence with students from uci uc riverside uc santa barbara and ucla the highly competitive program includes up to 500 in travel expenses free housing and a meal plan or a 2 500 stipend as well as 600 for incidental expenses the cohort was also a diverse group of students with almost 40 coming from groups that are underrepresented in the quantitative sciences we were able to recruit a significant number of students from historically excluded backgrounds with the hope of increasing diversity in the field of biostatistics says minin that was a very important goal because many are first generation college students who typically lack information about graduate school and about the many career options open to them the program included career preparedness activities including a workshop on the grad school application process and a q a with ph d students and outlined classes that students should take to have a more competitive application making this information available to everyone levels the playing field a little bit explains minin people from pharmaceutical and biotech companies including uci data science graduate jessica george came to talk with students about careers in the biotech industry in addition communications coach bri mcwhorter gave a two hour workshop on how to present scientific information helping prepare students for their research presentations on the final day of the program karren messer who is a professor and chief of the division of biostatistics at the herbert wertheim school of public health at uc san diego gave a talk and offered students valuable feedback on their presentations it was a very impressive group of students says gillen chair of the uci department of statistics they came in and within six weeks they did three weeks of courses both on technical and soft skills and then they jumped right into three weeks of real research pounding out an amazing amount of work and giving wonderful presentations at the end of it real world research a smashing successstudents attending the program started with lectures and labs conducted by six different instructors and a statistics ph d student teaching assistant learning how to design and analyze clinical trials model infectious disease dynamics and analyze big data in genomics transcriptomics and imaging the students came from various backgrounds so we spent the first three weeks making sure they were all on the same page in terms of their technical knowledge says minin we devoted this time to checking off all the boxes of what they needed to know for their research projects students then worked under the supervision of research mentors in addition to statistics professors gillen minin and shahbaba the following also served as mentors louis ehwerhemuepha manager of computational research choc research institute lauren gyllenhammer assistant professor of pediatrics uci daniel parker assistant professor of population health and disease prevention uci elizabeth read assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering uci and pathik wadhwa professor of psychiatry human behavior uci the real heart of the program was the research projects and that was only possible because of the dedication of the biomedical scientists whom we asked to participate says minin it was a smashing success because of their engagement with the students in addition four statistics ph d students provided invaluable support to the teams during the project phase of the institute the research covered the following topics analyzing the impact of maternal stress volatility during pregnancy on child health outcomes predicting maternal stress during pregnancy understanding movement patterns of farmers and forest workers from the thailand myanmar border conducting a spatio temporal analysis of melioidosis cases in lao people s democratic republic uncovering gene gene interaction motifs from single cell transcriptomic data and assessing associations between congenital conditions and covid 19 severity in children i was motivated to apply to this program because i was thrilled to get my hands on some real world biomedical data do collaborative research and learn from world class experts in statistics by means of the uci department of statistics faculty says dante ramirez an undergraduate majoring in statistics and minoring in bioethics at the university of washington what i liked best about the program was the opportunity to collaborate with like minded statisticians in a clinical research setting working with a cohort of statisticians and data scientists with relatively homogeneous skills in this setting and being guided by statistical mentors is such a special opportunity in learning my own strengths and weaknesses how to effectively communicate and work with others and how to do contemporary clinical and quantitative research although ramirez had originally intended to go straight into industry after graduating he has since changed his plans the isi buds program convinced me to apply to a biostatistics or public health graduate school program as this would make my goal of transitioning into a public health regulatory position much more attainable the research groups have some fun after giving their presentations left vladimir minin pink shirt and right dan gillen blue shirt with their student groups exploring so calboth ramirez and schlund were impressed by the research experience gained as well as by the ability to enjoy some downtime and explore southern california i was pleasantly surprised with the culture of the department and how plentiful the weekend activities were says ramirez as they were very conducive of bonding between my cohort and meeting various graduate students schlund agreed the professors also made large efforts to get to know us personally outside of dedicated lecture and research time they planned and attended weekend events that included kayaking whale watching hiking etc she says every professor in the program has been exceptionally personable kind and genuine to every student in the program summer 2023isi buds has secured funding for a minimum of five years so planning for summer 2023 is already underway registration will open in march 2023 and you can visit the application page for more information we want to make sure that we re feeding a diverse pipeline for the stem fields in general but also for biostatistics and statistics says gillen so we re going to continue to grow the program we hope that it becomes a hallmark of the department to be able to attract bright students into the graduate programs not just at uci but for

top 10 jobs in 2022 according to u s news world report the growing popularity of data focused careers has created a demand for students who understand the immense challenges and real world impact of complex data analysis this demand is the backdrop for the socal data science program a collaborative effort between faculty from uci california state university fullerton csuf and cypress college aimed at recruiting training and dispatching a diverse workforce of stem and data science majors led by statistics professors babak shahbaba and mine dogucu of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics and mathematics professor roberto pelayo the program is funded through a national science foundation grant preparing a diverse workforce via academic and industrial partnership with 1 5 million in funding across the three institutes and over the next three years the goal is to recruit 120 fellows from the three campuses offering targeted coursework and hands on training research opportunities and career development workshops the program is off to a strong start with 32 fellows selected from a pool of more than 200 applicants this diverse cohort is 87 women and students from other historically underrepresented backgrounds having such a diverse and strong group of students is amazing says shahbaba that was one of the goals of the program students and faculty of the socal data science program during the winter and spring this first cohort of students took data science courses developed through the socal data science program and offered at uci csuf or cypress college then the students put their new skills to the test with a summer research project rigorous training at summer bootcampprior to starting the six week research project students attended a one week bootcamp at uci the topics covered included exploratory data analysis advanced r programing and generalized linear models we had students coming from different backgrounds and fields computer science statistics biological sciences and we wanted to make sure that before they started doing research they had the required skills says shahbaba the bootcamp brought everyone together in terms of research preparedness the students really helped each other and worked well together the bootcamp also included a session on ethics in data science as well as training in professional and academic development we focused on more than just data science covering resume writing and interview skills says shahbaba and we invited graduate students to talk about their experiences in grad school real world research experienceonce the bootcamp ended students broke into several groups with each group diving into a real world data analysis project it was six weeks of intense research says shahbaba they were on campus at least three days a week from 10 a m to 4 p m working in the new interdisciplinary science and engineering building iseb at uci designed for collaborative research it s such a well designed space for these kind of projects it made our collaboration with the industrial and academic partners very smooth and productive students collaborating in an iseb classroom shahbaba lined up a variety of academic and non academic partners for the summer projects children s hospital of orange county choc the center of hydro meteorology and remote sensing chrs the fleischman lab the fortin lab and the reich lab the program was an amazing experience for me because it really gave me a chance to apply skills i learned from my courses to real world problems says program fellow giles pierre carlos a data science major at uci i was able to apply the techniques i ve learned and build significant models for an extremely interesting area of neuroscience research at the undergraduate research symposium on aug 4 2022 the last day of the summer program carlos and his teammates presented their work on understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of memory their project modeling nonspatial sequence memory task using neural decoding leveraged data provided by dr norbert fortin and the fortin lab at uci the program was collaborative in nature and because of that i learned how to solve statistical problems in a team setting says carlos on top of that the program solidified my interest in obtaining a master s in statistics and even made me open to going for a ph d in the future overall the program made a huge impact on where i want to take my career alyssandrei parinas who is studying computer science at cypress college and worked with carlos on the neuroscience project agreed the entire experience was challenging yet very rewarding she says the program taught me a lot of things and allowed me to better understand what data science is ayah halabi a mathematics major at csuf conducted research on how diet can affect symptoms related to myeloproliferative neoplasms mpn a cancer located within the blood and bone marrow her team s project impact of mediterranean and dash diets on mpn symptoms leveraged data from dr angela fleischman of uci s school of medicine and the fleischman lab this program has taught me so much about the data science world and how important it is to make our lives better wrote halabi in a linkedin post i fell in love with the field and with all the challenges and complexities it holds i m so grateful to have learned such important skills and worked with amazing faculty there were also projects related to covid 19 and pediatric cystic fibrosis that leveraged data from choc and a project on smartphones and infant language development used data from stephanie reich of uci s school of education the final team analyzed rainfall over time using data provided by phu nguyen and chrs students

september 22 2022 in july 2022 the donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics welcomed hengrui cai as an assistant professor of statistics can you tell us a bit about your background and how you decided on statistics i m originally from southeastern china and i m the only child in my family growing up my mom and my grandma encouraged me to be independent and to seek a career i would enjoy and fight for my entire life when i took the exam to go to college i got full marks in mathematics this gave me the confidence to choose a mathematics related major as an undergraduate student at zhejiang university what inspired me to do a deep dive into the statistics major was the fourth industrial revolution happening during that time related to the realization of society version 5 0 we re in the process of imagining some new society where we will heavily rely on big data to solve challenges and to figure out how people can use artificial intelligence to live better therefore i decided to get a minor in the advanced honor class of engineering education at chu kochen honors college which granted me great opportunities to work with outstanding peers across the university and learn cutting edge technologies to integrate statistics and machine learning elegantly what motivated you to then earn your ph d during my undergraduate i attended several mathematical and machine learning competitions and won the meritorious winner in american mathematical contest yet i could still see my limitations in knowledge which motivated me to reach for the highest standard and become an expert in statistics and machine learning after a summer research internship at the university of alberta in canada i decided to go abroad for higher education and came to the united states after earning my bachelor s degree i spent five years at north carolina state university and got my ph d in statistics under the co supervision of dr wenbin lu and dr rui song my dissertation was on optimal decision making and policy evaluation with complex data which leverage causal inference and reinforcement learning to help us make the right decisions for the right people at the right time during that time i also spent three years interning at amazon that was another excellent opportunity for me to see the real world impact of computer science and statistics and how our research contributes to industry and society can you talk about your research focus i have broad research interests in methodology and theory in causal inference reinforcement learning and graphical modeling and in how they interact to establish reliable powerful and interpretable solutions to a variety of real world problems currently i m working in two main directions one is personalized decision making and policy evaluation for complex data this area integrates the techniques of causal inference and reinforcement learning which enables us to answer counterfactual questions so we can make better decisions in an interactive environment some use cases include precision medicine and personalized recommendations in e commerce i m also very interested in causal discovery with emerging challenges in big data this area leverages causal inference and graphical models to disentangle the complex relationship among variables and deliver the results in an explainable way my long term research goal is to teach a machine to learn the logic from the facts so what brought you to uci first of all i love irvine this city is vivid elegant and multicultural with a lot of young tech companies presenting appealing opportunities for collaboration the second reason is owing to the great research communities inside uci and around the uc system there are so many outstanding faculty members here i would like to work with in my department in the school of ics and across the university also where else can we find the departments of statistics computer science and informatics all in the same school it s a very unique place what courses will you be teaching i will be teaching a course in spring 2023 for undergraduates called introduction to probability and statistics in the future i would like to design some new courses on reinforcement machine learning and on causal discovery is there a book you d like to recommend to students the book of why by judea pearl and dana mackenzie this book is for non technical people who are interested in causal discovery explaining how we understand or formulate causality in real problems and highlighting the difference between correlation and causation it helps us understand the logic of things happening dive into the essence of human thought and use the causal principle as the key to applying artificial intelligence to solve real problems in meaningful ways what do you do in your spare time i like hiking going to the beach and being out in the sunshine i also like to go kayaking and standup paddle boarding if i have a bit more time i like to travel to new places i ve only been in irvine for a few months and i ve already been to las vegas death valley antelope valley and san francisco then from san francisco i drove down the coast to los angeles next i plan to visit san diego and yosemite work hard play hard i enjoy different views which open my eyes and my mind i also like to watch movies to experience different lives one of my favorites is forrest gump hengrui cai at death valley left and along california state route 1 right finally what do you like best so far about uci the people here are so nice i have received a lot of support from my department chair faculty members and department staff during my relocation and onboarding which is extremely helpful for the early stage of my career there are also plenty of opportunities for collaborating and i have been invited to give some talks for example i gave a talk in early september on optimal subgroup identification via constrained policy tree search for choc research i will continue to explore the fantastic research community at and around uci as i study how statistics and machine learning can uniquely contribute to interdisciplinary solutions and i will

third year he transitioned to computer science graduating with a b s in that discipline in 1974 in the mid 1970s uci established a master s degree program in computer science and butterworth was one of its early graduates uci is where i began my career as a computer scientist and software engineer he said while at uci i met another person who was a graduate student at the time and we ended up working together well into the 1980s you could say uci is where all of my success really started butterworth said he would not have been able to complete his college education without the monetary support he received as a student i was considering not going to the university unless i received financial aid because i didn t have any money but when uci came through with a package to help out that

long beach city council member watch her inauguration online starting at minute 58 30 as a child joni ricks oddie would often join her grandfather at county commissioner meetings in chicago so it s no surprise that when ricks oddie was sworn in for her new seat on the long beach city council on dec 22 2022 she had her family in tow she took her oath of office with her right arm raised and her left arm holding her young daughter as a wife and mother of two small children it is of utmost importance to me that we make our civic spaces open welcoming and inclusive teaching the next generation the necessity of civic engagement she said during her inauguration speech that lesson starts with them seeing their parents have the ability to be full members and make their voices heard i want to lead by example and let people know families are always welcome in addition to exemplifying her life as a mom in support of family friendly civic spaces ricks oddie also spotlighted her work in epidemiology and statistics in support of more impactful leadership as someone with a science and research background i want to bring data and metrics to the way we make decisions in the city she noted to ensure we are making the most well informed decisions on the ways we invest in our city particularly our most vulnerable communities ricks oddie earned her ph d in epidemiology from ucla and now serves as director of the center for statistical consulting housed in uc irvine s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics she is also director of the biostatistics epidemiology and research design berd unit within uci s institute for clinical and translational sciences icts this professional backdrop gives her a unique understanding of the power of data and as she takes on her new role as council member for the city of long beach representing district 9 she plans to leverage that knowledge to positively impact her community what was the most memorable part of your inauguration the official swearing is at the city clerk s office but the public inauguration ceremony was a ton of fun i had my friend and mentor yvonne wheeler who is president of the l a county federation of labor swear me in and my husband and two kids were supposed to be on stage with me but my son had to go to the bathroom he said he couldn t hold it so my father in law took him as i was giving my speech but it worked out perfectly because my speech talked about the importance of family and children and civic engagement the reason i bring my kids to everything is to make it an inclusive space for families i live in a community of young people of color so we have a lot of families moving in how are we going to grow the next generation of civic leaders if people aren t comfortable bringing their kids so it starts with us as leaders demonstrating that it s okay so just as i finish talking about this and i m shaking hands with some of the other city council members my father in law returns with my son i pick him up and give him a hug and then he says i wanna say something and he grabs the microphone and says hi i m cohen many people thought that was the highlight of the event it was a perfect example of the importance of family and just being a mom in the middle of all that so that was my favorite moment joni ricks oddie holding her son at the inauguration ceremony for the long beach city council how does your position as director of the center for statistical consulting help you in this role at my second city council meeting we announced an emergency declaration on homelessness we have an emergency operation center called the elc and we have around a 100 staff members in long beach dedicated to spending the next 100 days focusing completely on homelessness and sending us reports so the friday before our second meeting is when we got our homelessness report and it was 100 pages i had to read and analyze the report before our tuesday meeting this is the benefit of having somebody with a ph d who is used to looking at data and quickly determining what s happening joni ricks oddie at a city council meeting i ll give you another example there was a slide talking about race and ethnicity related to homelessness because we re trying to approach the problem with an equity lens to identify which racial groups are most heavily impacted in long beach it s african americans so on this one slide there were two data points that just seemed contradictory to each other one was saying that black people tend to spend the fewest days unhoused but they were also vastly more likely to be back on the street 12 months after being housed like 62 compared to the 20 for the next highest group which were white people so what the heck is happening that we get black people off the street quickly but within a year we are back where we started in the meeting i pointed out that this cycle is alarming i then had residents and advocates thanking me for the depth of my questions because i m not sure others had enough time to review the data to make that connection how do your efforts to address the needs of your community give you a different lens for viewing your work in academia it s the importance of implementation we do all this research but we often don t get to see the final dissemination and implementation how do we take what we do and literally translate it into something that impacts people that s exactly what i get the opportunity to do now which is why the work is so important it s basically asking how do you take best practices which is what we re supposed to be doing here as researchers and implement that but then the counterpoint is if we re trying to implement these policies what s the feedback loop to research that s what s missing which is why i think somebody with my background is important to have in a position like this we don t have the feedback loop to know which programs and policies didn t work out the way we thought they would when scaled for a larger audience but having that knowledge can inform how we do our research and create useful interventions you ve said that you want to advocate for an office of data and evaluation why is that important data is great and information is great but what are you going to do with it how can it influence policy and help you apply for grants that can lead to interventions i m hoping to demonstrate to my council colleagues over time that data tells you a story and then based on that story you can present a series of policies to address inequities the level of challenges that we re dealing with right now impresses the need for a holistic view we have to do many things all at once if we re actually going to make an impact which means you need to understand the full breadth of the issue i m building the case right now for eventually hiring a unit of people with expertise in gathering and analyzing data to get the whole story and give us that holistic view ricks oddie on the campaign trail with her daughter in addition to homelessness you also want to focus on health equity which became personal for you after the birth of your daughter how do you plan to tackle that issue when it comes to the issue around health equity this is actually related to black residents as well so i have been working over time with what s called the black health equity collaborative an organization born out of the framework for racial reconciliation that the city of long beach implemented right after the murder of george floyd the document was designed to make the city accountable toward its black residents it includes milestones metrics and objectives on how to engage with black residents out of that we started exploring how to tie things together to focus on communities of color we already had an office of equity we already had a health department but how do we make sure each community is getting the attention that it needs black residents need it latino residents need it our pacific islander groups need it including our samoans our tongans our chamorro population who are barely even a blip in the data they re never disaggregated out i talked to several of them when i was knocking on doors campaigning and they said they don t even feel visible most of the time at the city level so when we talk about health equity it s about being intentional about those communities that have been marginalized historically and don t even get a voice at the city level and really engaging them with them to uplift their voices and their needs there s a lot of work to do can you also talk about your efforts to expose underrepresented minority urm middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science stephanie reyes tuccio is the assistant vice chancellor for uci s center for educational partnerships cfep which has a group of managers under her that focus on urm students so statistics professor veronica berrocal and i participated in one of their workshops for students in the long beach paramount and compton school districts we did a presentation talking about statistics and what you can do with it and we recruited some students of color from the department of statistics to share their experiences i ve done a couple of presentations with veronica through the cfep talking about the work we do and trying to collaborate with them on projects so ics can be a partner in general but it s interesting because when talking about careers this isn t a pipeline problem it s a recruitment problem we need to better target urm student blocks and expose them to open positions i m a black woman so i have a much more diverse network but you have to be intentional about building a network that is diverse enough to attract the best candidate don t tell me there s no black people or latino people for a position they re out there what are we doing to find them this relates to your icts black thriving initiative strategic plan can you tell us about that after george floyd s murder icts the institute for clinical and translational science started a working group that fall a visioning process about how icts could join with uci s black thriving initiative bti we were trying to assess how we could leverage the resources at icts to double down on our commitment to diversity and make sure we were doing our due diligence to increase the diversity of the clinical translational sciences because historically as much work as it does icts as an entity has not been super diverse again it s just levels of intentionality so we drafted what i think is a comprehensive plan that leverages our strengths and talks about regional partnerships we came up with a series of goals metrics and objectives that map to the three pillars of bti leverage the mission change the culture and engage black communities that was fall of 2020 so how s it going it s been really great we ve been engaging with our education unit to get them to increase the number of nih diversity supplements contacting eligible researchers we ve had a lot of success with that over the last couple of years going from around two supplement applications to six with i think five out of those six being awarded we re also making sure our labs and research groups have culturally competent researchers so when students of color come in they have a sense of belonging and feel comfortable it s all these little interventions you need to do along the way to make things easier and more inclusive we also have a steering committee for the icts that meets every week and we have speakers come in quarterly to talk about different topics related to dei diversity equity and inclusion such as race as a biological versus social construct because race is often controlled and included in analyses and most people don t really know why they include race so we re teaching researchers to critically think about those things or we ve talked about precision of language we had a researcher dr monica mclemore of the university of washington talk about how people use words like equity diversity and inclusion and conflate all these terms without really understanding what they mean we ve also had people talk about workforce development in the clinical space to not only recruit a diverse set of students and faculty but also to think about our clinical trials because we re often testing things on a very specific group demographic we found out the problems of that during the pandemic i don t know if you heard about what happened with the pulse oximeters for measuring your blood oxygen levels but research has shown that the darker your skin the poorer the reading black people with darker skin would go into the emergency room saying i can t breathe but the pulse oximeter reading would say you re at 100 oxygen saturation so the doctors would say you re fine because the finger oximeter couldn t read through darker skin these are things we need to think about during clinical trials when we re testing devices the color of someone s skin matters this ties back into the question of what kind of data you re getting and whether you re getting the full picture from that data on that note and given that it s black history month is there something you d like to share as a source of inspiration there s a book called black like me it s old it s literally like a 50 year old book originally published in 1960 but it s basically the true story of a gentleman a journalist who s white john howard griffin who darkens his skin and then goes to live in the south as a black man it is a fantastic book because you re still the same person but once you remove the privilege of your skin the author experienced what it is like to live through the lens of not having the privilege of whiteness i remember reading that book back when i was maybe in high school and it s a great read and i still remember it to this day anything else you d like to add if there s anyone out there who s interested in the work i m doing on city council or who wants to be a resource or to bend joni s ear on an issue let me know there s going to be times when i m looking for subject matter expertise in particular areas obviously i talk about homelessness but there s tons of things that cities as large as long beach have to address so i d love to be able to interface with my colleagues here at uci and use them to get subject matter information to myself and my colleagues so please reach out shani murray uc irvine alumni paul and jo butterworth

strategy lead at snap inc uses airflow python git and bigquery machine learning matt weiss who is a data science manager at meta shared more holistic advice on building good mlops think of the whole

half of the discussion concluded with panelists sharing some mistakes they made in the workplace and the lessons they learned from those mistakes weiss in particular talked about an instance in which he analyzed and interpreted data based on his own assumptions without consulting his colleagues if you are creating anything make sure to check against something that s already been solved said weiss don t make assumptions and find the source of truth if you re trying to re create something you may have some big things you missed career developmentnooravi detailed the challenges she experienced when transitioning to her first career after college at her first job noovari was the youngest and only female employee on her team and several of her colleagues had ph d degrees or had more work experience than her leading her to feel and be isolated and have imposter syndrome i had managers who were very supportive i had friends who were very supportive noovari said explaining that her support system helped her overcome difficulties at work she also highlighted the importance of diversity in the technology industry sharing a time when she was asked to speak on a panel at a conference that typically only invited male speakers the conference later developed an all woman panel peach then asked the panelists several questions about what they wished they had done early on in their career and to give the audience advice on how to succeed in new roles weiss said taking big swings by making high impact decisions is a powerful way to move forward and talucci suggested asking for help when you need it and documenting processes especially when you re new anywhere i do this every time i m new to a job being able to document all the processes that you re going through is always helpful talucci said giving examples such as tracking failures taking screenshots and more to put in your documentation level setting according to noovari is another important skill that helps when working in teams or with stakeholders what i tend to do is err on the side of over communicating noovari said which she explains is a good strategy when being given requests with unrealistic deadlines because stakeholders better understand where she is in the process and can shift their expectations it s when they don t know what s going on is when i think issues come up the last major question of the night was what hard or soft skills will help people level up in their career intellectual curiosity weiss said specifically in my world i look for who can take the question and build the biggest impact and influence with their insights someone who s willing to go the extra mile but be able to really formulate everything from start to finish so they can sell it noovari emphasized developing your communication skills noting that this is not limited to verbal communication like speaking up in meetings i have a lot of introverts on my team and i tell them if it s a zoom call just add things in the chat they can be really good at communication via email written communication can be very strong and offset them not speaking up in meetings noovari said so being an introvert isn t a bad thing it s actually just finding a medium in which you can exercise your skills karen phan student creativity and innovation take center stage at hack at uci 2023faculty spotlight veronica

veronica berrocal tried to convince herself that she did not want to follow in her father s footsteps and study statistics today that young girl from italy is a professor of statistics at uc irvine s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics she has been named a fellow of the american statistical association asa for research in spatial and spatio temporal statistics and applications to atmospheric and environmental sciences and environmental epidemiology she has served as chair of the section in environmental sciences envibayes of the international society of bayesian analysis isba and she has advised the environmental protection agency epa sharing her statistical expertise on scientific advisory panels learn here what finally drew her to the field after years of resistance and how she s now sharing her passion for statistics with others illustrating its impact and importance how did you first become interested in statistics my dad studied statistics but when i was younger i didn t want to do what my dad did when i was in high school and considering what to study at the university i was very undecided my mom suggested that i study math since i really liked it and math has a large number of applications i remember her mentioning atmospheric sciences and weather forecasting so i decided on math stayed clear of anything that had to do with probability or statistics and ended up specializing in differential geometry after getting my b s and m s degrees in math i came to the u s to michigan state university on a scholarship to do research as part of this research i had to learn genetics and how to model genetics data since i did not know statistics i had to take some classes but ones offered not by the department of statistics and probability but by the department of animal science where i was conducting my research i started to take these classes with the goal of developing a model to identify ways to maximize animal production although the statistical topics were interesting i was not really satisfied with the application and the focus on animal production so i decided to take classes from the department of statistics and probability and get a master s in statistics as i did that i got more and more into it and that s how i found myself wanting to go for a ph d so that s how it all started it s funny because i actually ended up following in my dad s footsteps can you talk about how your work blends the fields of statistics and environmental science the environment and environmental science were things i was always interested in even though i didn t grow up in a family of people who typically go hiking camping or anything like that i was interested in animals and i ve always wanted to advocate for the weaker links seeing animals get mistreated trees get cut down or a piece of land get urbanized has always made me sad so i ve always been interested in environmental conservation and when i applied to the ph d program at the university of washington i saw on the webpage of my advisor adrian raftery a project that excited me he wanted to estimate the size of the whale population specifically the bowhead whale the whaling commission needed to establish the quota of whales that could be hunted per year so they needed to have an idea of how many whales there were in the wild that s not easy to determine as one needs to estimate the size of the population based on what one sees occasionally when i went to visit the department though i was told that the funding for the project was over i still ended up going there for my ph d and working with adrian on a project related to atmospheric sciences and weather as my mom predicted years before from there i got interested in developing and applying statistical methods to answer questions in atmospheric sciences e g weather climate air pollution so i ve been interested in this particular area of science for a long time of course now with the threats connected to climate change becoming more and more evident people are very interested in environmental science research in connection to human health and sustainability as well what projects are you working on i ve spent a considerable amount of time working on projects related to air pollution that was something i started to work on during my postdoc and i m still working on it in fact i m collaborating with jun wu here at uci on a couple of projects that are focused on estimating air pollution levels in california and quantifying the effect of wildfires particularly on pregnant women i have also recently been invited to be part of an advisory panel that will be reviewing a tool the epa has developed called ejscreen the tool lets you map and compare exposure to various environmental risk factors across space air pollution is of course one of the environmental risk factors that poses a threat to human health more recently i ve become interested in climate change not only for its effects on human health or natural habitats but also in terms of agricultural production at this point despite the climate disinformation campaign i hope everybody understands that the climate is changing and that global warming is real for me even though i know that addressing climate change requires making country level political decisions across the globe especially by the countries that are the biggest polluters i realized that i want to contribute to research on climate change more on the front of mitigation what can we do to mitigate the effects of climate change you re also helping expose underrepresented minority middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science can you talk a bit about those efforts i ve been thinking about the issue of diversity in statistics for a long time in part because i am mixed race and i never completely felt at ease in certain environments so i always think about how it feels to be a student in a field where you don t see many other people like you or you don t recognize your experience in the experience of your peers the only way things can change is if we increase the number of students and faculty from diverse backgrounds there is a lot of effort in trying to recruit students into the graduate program but i think we need to start a little bit earlier for some disciplines it s easy for students to think i want to become a doctor or i want to be an engineer because people are familiar with these careers but if you re not around people who are familiar with the department of statistics or the school of ics you might not really know about data science as i was thinking about how we might reach middle or high school students i talked to joni ricks oddie director of uci s center for statistical consulting joni had a connection with uci s center for educational partnerships cfep and she introduced me to the group we did our first panel discussion together with high school students from orange county after that first event i did other presentations with cfep i really enjoy talking to these kids and hope they will consider going to college for data science and maybe even grad school but even just getting them into data science as an undergraduate is a win there needs to be more outreach to put statistics and data science on the map for people as i gave these presentations i realized that many high school students don t know what data science is or what type of jobs one could do with a degree in data science many high school students also don t know what a professor does besides teaching you also did a seminar series on data science careers correct two years ago i got an ics inspiration award and i organized a seminar series on career paths that was meant to help graduate students because of the pandemic the seminars were all hosted on zoom despite not being in person i managed to invite people from different sectors so that they could give graduate students an idea of the types of careers they could pursue after completing either their master s or ph d degree with the seminars i also wanted to help take away the anxiety that students often have of thinking i have to figure out my life completely once i get my degree or i m stuck in a certain career for the rest of my life i wanted students to know that there are many different paths that one can construct our first speaker violeta hennessey works at paramount pictures she got her ph d in biostatistics at md anderson and is now the director of paramount s digital archives and analytics another speaker luke bornn used to be the vice president of strategy and analytics for an nba team and now is co founder of a sports analytics company but he started as a professor we also had speakers in more traditional careers a data scientist who works at google a director of biostatistics within a pharmaceutical company a professor focused mostly on statistical education and a researcher who works in a government lab all the speakers talked about how they built their career and what types of problems or projects they typically work on students really liked it anyone interested in viewing the seminars can contact me how has public awareness around statistics changed since you first entered the field i can definitely say that even though i have only been a faculty member for 13 or 14 years i can see the impact of statistics on public discourse i remember when i was still an assistant professor at the university of michigan and i got invited as an ad hoc member to join advisory panels i would often be the only statistician on the panel the rest of the panel was composed of toxicologists and environmental health scientists now i get emails where the epa explicitly states that they are looking for people with biostatistics or statistics expertise to serve on this or that advisory panel and i think that s true for many other advisory panels more and more the importance of statistics is being recognized and statisticians are getting more involved in the public discourse i think this really speaks to the impact of statistics it s women s history month any women in stem trailblazers you want to spotlight keeping it close to the areas of statistics that i work in there are two women that i would like to highlight francesca dominici from harvard university was among the first statisticians to work on studies that assess the impact of air pollution on health using very large population level studies she has contributed to evidence on the adverse health effects of air pollution and her work continues to have enormous impact i really look up to her also anybody who works in bayesian statistics and spatial and environmental epidemiology knows sylvia richardson her work on bayesian computation mcmc and on spatial modeling are part of fundamental knowledge for anybody who works in spatial epidemiology from a bayesian perspective our own department of statistics also has two trailblazers jessica utts and annie qu jessica s impact on statistical education is long lasting thousands of students have learned statistics in their undergraduate classes using one of jessica s books and annie s research breadth and contribution to statistics are quite hard to match i don t think there are many statisticians who have never encountered her name on a statistical paper seen her name on the program of a statistical conference or seen her give a presentation so we don t have to go far to find inspiring women shani murray mds

emily truong moves to the rhythm of algorithms march 16 2023 as a dancer fourth year honors student emily truong has seen countless injuries around her she wanted to study dance and biology on a pre medicine track and become a doctor however after exploring the field of data science truong learned about the large scale impact she can make on the healthcare industry through data and was inspired to double major in dance and data science during my first year i took all these math classes and i was looking into which pathways use a lot of math says truong she also shadowed data scientists at a financial technology firm and self taught herself python the summer before college i thought data science could be an interesting pathway to go through so i started taking some data science classes and realized that i really liked it truong shared that her experience of touring uci was memorable and unique compared to other schools she toured which is one of the reasons she decided to attend uci one thing i remembered about uci was my campus tour guide said that uci was the first school to reverse boil an egg she says i thought uci was really pretty and calm truong is also minoring in bioinformatics and says research is a big part of her time at uci research is how she blends her passion for medicine with data since her second year truong has worked with health researchers as a research assistant in informatics professor kai zheng s lab she is also a student manager and supervises fellow student researchers in the lab she is especially proud of a yearlong study she worked on that examined pre and post covid 19 opioid overdoses which will be published and presented in april at the uc real world evidence conference currently truong is working with uci health s all of us database to gather information on patient recruitment in clinical trials join clubs and organizations a lot of research positions are passed down that way networking is also really important she says adding that contacting professors directly and reading emails from the ics student affairs office are other ways to find openings in research labs outside of her data science classes and research at uci truong is part of the engineering fraternity theta tau where she created a gesture controlled automated curtain with her fraternity brothers this past summer she interned at kaiser permanente and worked with data on hypertension heart attack and stroke outcomes and suicide prevention truong has spent the second half of her college career focused on research and learning more about data science to prepare herself for a career in data science her double major in dance and data science helps her balance the stress and demands of her math and computer science classes because she enjoys the creativity stimulation and exercise in her dance classes after i come out of computer science class i m like oh i m so tired but after i go to dance class it boosts my energy says truong it s a really nice balance when she graduates truong hopes to continue dancing recreationally many of the soft skills she applies to her research and internship experience in data science come from dancing which she has been doing since she was 5 years old she says her work ethic time management and planning skills and creativity all come from dancing one of emily s hobbies is crocheting her latest creation is this frog with a busy school schedule truong turns to a few activities and hobbies to de stress she is part of a dance team on campus called project renegade and the sorority tri delta and enjoys attending dance performances on campus to support her peers she also likes to spend time with her friends and crochet her most recent creation is a frog truong is interested in careers in data science that will allow her to influence people and improve lives at scale her internship at kaiser permanente has also inspired her to pursue a graduate degree in data science and a role in predictive analysis one of the things that brought me into data science was realizing that i could do a lot of work behind the scenes and actually impact a lot of people at once she says karen phan faculty

science for both data uci and the wider community of data enthusiasts at uci colin yee a second year data science major and vice president of community development at data uci says planning the club s inaugural datathon would not have been possible without the dedication and marketing efforts of their board members and interns since this is our first datathon we had to essentially start from scratch says yee one of the biggest challenges was securing data challenges and funding for our event we ve sent hundreds of emails and linkedin messages to different companies and organizations with a dozen at most responding back we were very glad of the sponsors and funding we were able to receive according to data uci president and third year data science major william hou the club s hard work paid off the datathon exceeded hou s expectations before it officially began our team has never put on an event like this before so there was a lot of uncertainty especially when we first started planning around whether people would actually sign up says hou we ended up not only meeting our attendance goal but actually having to waitlist some of our applicants due to capacity limitations hou also expresses excitement about successfully putting a data related spin on traditional software hackathons adding that data uci plans to host a bigger and better datathon next year data uci hopes to build a strong reputation for its collegiate datathon in the years to come in the meantime hou and yee encourage students to continue participating in datathons you have the opportunity to work in a team and analyze data from different companies and organizations says yee a datathon like this can help motivate students to learn different data related applications and to implement the skills they

establish a data science major uc irvine has been an educational leader in this growing field for close to a decade in addition to launching the major in 2015 uci recently started hosting summer programs for both high school and undergraduate students interested in data analytics and biostatistics and its socal data science program helps recruit train and dispatch a diverse workforce of stem and data science majors now the socal data science program is scaling up thanks to a 1 3 million pathways development grant from the california education learning lab the socal data science programthe socal data science program kicked off in 2022 with a three year 1 5 million grant from the national science foundation the program is a collaborative effort between faculty from uci california state university fullerton csuf and cypress college and the inaugural cohort of 32 fellows drawn from all three campuses attended a one week training bootcamp and conducted a six week research project at uci last summer professor babak shahbaba with the program welcoming 30 new fellows later this month statistics professor babak shahbaba of uci s donald bren school of information and computer sciences ics is already looking to the future as we are working with this new cohort finishing the second year we re thinking about continuity and sustainability says shahbaba the program lead at uci we don t want the program and the benefit that it provides to end when the nsf grant ends the new four year pathways development grant guarantees that the benefits will continue creating a pipeline of talentthe grant proposal titled pipe line programs for institutional pathway engagement accelerating infrastructure and education outlines ways to develop pathways and overcome equity gaps in data science learning csuf will serve as the host organization with professor jessica jaynes as project lead partnering closely with faculty from uci riverside city college rcc and rio hondo college rhc this grant will help us continue and expand our activities around data science education at the undergraduate level says shahbaba and this actually goes beyond the students it includes developing training materials and hosting workshops for instructors to build the required infrastructure the socal data science program aligns perfectly with the california learning lab s grand challenge on building critical mass for data science the learning lab wanted to establish this relationship between different tiers of academic institutes in california and we were already doing that with a uc cal state and community college says shahbaba the pipe line proposal has three overarching goals create pathways in data science between the three institutional tiers by establishing new courses and programs address equity gaps in data science education by expanding access to technology resources incorporating culturally relevant pedagogy and applying a content with context approach and support a diverse group of faculty and students in data science resulting in a robust community of data science learners the proposal doesn t extend the number of fellows 120 expected to be funded with the nsf grant rather it helps ensure other students have access to the same type of data science education outside of the program it s more about building the infrastructure to replicate the training that we ve been providing to these fellows and to scale it up says shahbaba as part of this work ics will host training workshops and an annual data science education conference helping instructors establish data science courses at community colleges and building a strong sense of community and at cal state fullerton adds shahbaba we will look into setting up a data science major and minor this creates a pipeline of talent for not only industry but for graduate programs as well we provide this program to help the students but also it helps uci in a way explains shahbaba two of the fellows from cal state fullerton in last year s cohort were among the 11 students accepted into uci s statistics ph d program this year so it s a two way gateway we transfer the knowledge and experience that we have developed over many years and in return we re recruiting these highly diverse skilled and motivated students pipe line thus aims to arm the next generation of data scientists with the knowledge and tools needed to tackle tomorrow s biggest challenges students well trained in data science at the undergraduate level strengthen data analytics in all industries from healthcare to transportation and support graduate level statistical research that will advance our understanding of issues ranging from disease prevention to climate change leading to novel solutions shani murray ics and engineering

building on communities of supportdean marios then introduced etemadi an iranian american graduating with her master s degree in software engineering as etemadi took the stage she transported the audience back in time imagine for a moment that it s the year 2013 she started i was a nervous wreck of a 14 year old sitting in my counselor s office in selecting the last elective for her first year of high school she had to choose between woodshop or intro to computer programming she remembered calling her mom for advice ever the cautious parent she suggested computer programming i can t exactly chop my arm off with a keyboard and mouse said etemadi laughing that one decision ended up cultivating a love of programming within me she said dragging and dropping code blocks in scratch might have just been another elective course for some kids but for me it was a window into a whole new world after high school etemadi s dreams of attending an elite college came crashing down when she was rejected everywhere she applied so she found another path she attended west valley community college where she found a community of incredibly talented compassionate professors and students she went on to study computer science at uc davis where she again found a community of supportive classmates the culmination of which was a zoom graduation in her living room as a graduate student at uci her initial online connections flourished with the return to on campus learning and she collaborated with fellow graduate students and research lab members with help from her advisor andre van der hoek she developed a prototype tool that lets people edit videos to attach to bug reports now as she prepares to find a job as a software developer she looks forward to meeting yet another community of talented and supportive peers and colleagues she wishes the same for her fellow graduates advising the class of 2023 to carve out a space for themselves that builds on their unique experiences
